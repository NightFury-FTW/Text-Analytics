"This stuff is amazing.  Simply comparing the nutrition facts with any regular peanut butter immediately shows you the extreme difference in fat.  I know, I know, fat from nuts is supposedly ""good fat,"" but you still don't want too much of any type of fat in your diet.  PB2 essentially gets rid of the fat you don't need.  As I understand it, the peanuts are crushed down and the oil is soaked out of them.  Then, the remaining powdered peanuts are packaged up with a ""seasoning"" of salt and sugar (the ONLY other 2 ingredients in it) and you have PB2!<br /><br />To reconstitute it, all you do is add 1 tablespoon of water to 2 tablespoons of the powdered PB2 and mix until you have peanut-butter-consistency.  It really does taste just like peanut butter.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not afraid to say something tastes nasty when it's trying to be healthy.  He loved the taste and was even happier afterwards when I showed him the back of the bottle compared to our regular peanut butter bottle.

"Okay, I love many Newman's Own products (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTJ6IA"">Newman'S Own Marinara Pasta Sauce With Mushrooms ( 12x24 OZ)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTP1VG"">Newman's Own Ranch, 16-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>) so why not try giving some to my favorite furry friend?  The promises on the package look good - made with organic barley, no wheat, no corn - and the analysis on the back tells me that my West Highland White Terrier will receive 9% minimum of crude protein, 4% minimum of crude fat, 4% maximum of crude fiber.  The ingredients are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic applies, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), and organic molasses.<br /><br />So it sounds good, but how will it be received.  I cannot say that my Westie is a particularly fussy eater (I have yet to meet a terrier who is), but there have been times that he has opted to walk away rather than take a second treat, so I can only assume that after his first bite he was less than interested.  Like any good dog, he can running at the sound of the package rustling, with high hopes that this might be for him.  I pulled out a treat approximately the size of the mousepad on my laptop (or you can look at your keyboard - as wide as your Shift key and as tall as Enter and Shift together).  While my little guy thinks he's a big dog, I know better, so this had to be broken down.  Fortunately, there is a nice perforation down the middle making it easy to break apart for him.  That half would still be a pretty big treat for a smaller dog, but it works nicely for my little guy.<br /><br />I gave him one piece and he took it and waited, hoping I would go ahead and hand him the other so he could take them both away.  After I told him one was all he was going to get, he took his piece out in the yard (he likes to go on the deck to eat his treats).  In just a couple of minutes, he was back and waiting patiently for another.  As soon as I produced the other half, he was up on his back legs and watching that treat intently.  Even now he is watching me since he heard the crinkling as I was getting the information off the bag.  I think my Westie is Newman's Own's newest fan!<br /><br />These are a little pricier than the treats I typically purchase for him, but if you only use these for special treats it should not be too much.  Besides, it makes sense to me to care just as much about what I put into his body as I can about what I put into mine.",okay i love many newmans own products a href own marinara pasta sauce with mushrooms  x oza a href own ranch ounce pack of a so why not try giving some to my favorite furry friend  the promises on the package look good  made with organic barley no wheat no corn  and the analysis on the back tells me that my west highland white terrier will receive  minimum of crude protein  minimum of crude fat  maximum of crude fiber  the ingredients are organic barley organic lamb organic carrots organic applies organic palm oil preserved with mixed tocopherols a source of vitamin e and organic molassesbr br so it sounds good but how will it be received  i cannot say that my westie is a particularly fussy eater i have yet to meet a terrier who is but there have been times that he has opted to walk away rather than take a second treat so i can only assume that after his first bite he was less than interested  like any good dog he can running at the sound of the package rustling with high hopes that this might be for him  i pulled out a treat approximately the size of the mousepad on my laptop or you can look at your keyboard  as wide as your shift key and as tall as enter and shift together  while my little guy thinks hes a big dog i know better so this had to be broken down  fortunately there is a nice perforation down the middle making it easy to break apart for him  that half would still be a pretty big treat for a smaller dog but it works nicely for my little guybr br i gave him one piece and he took it and waited hoping i would go ahead and hand him the other so he could take them both away  after i told him one was all he was going to get he took his piece out in the yard he likes to go on the deck to eat his treats  in just a couple of minutes he was back and waiting patiently for another  as soon as i produced the other half he was up on his back legs and watching that treat intently  even now he is watching me since he heard the crinkling as i was getting the information off the bag  i think my westie is newmans owns newest fanbr br these are a little pricier than the treats i typically purchase for him but if you only use these for special treats it should not be too much  besides it makes sense to me to care just as much about what i put into his body as i can about what i put into mine,positive,positive

"Update:  Please note per my information below: product description and photo are no longer accurate.  The product has a sealed lid, not a ""pop-top lid"" and the amount of protein and sodium have changed.  See below for the correct information.  I have notified Amazon of this error.  Somehow 5 grams of protein have been ""lost"" from the can contents.<br /><br />I purchased the 4.5 ounce can of Swanson white premium chunk chicken breast on sale at CVS - buy one, get one free for $3.00 ($1.50 per can).  This large size can 12-pack works out to be a better deal even though it's not a sale price and subscribing to purchase this product on a schedule reduces the price per can even more.<br />I am wondering if the person who commented that the meat was a mixture of white and dark meat ordered or received the wrong product since there is a similar product available for a lower price that is a blend of white and dark meat.  This 9.75 ounce net weight can contains all white meat and just the right amount of broth that's easy to drain off or use.  The chicken looks appealing and it tastes mild and flavorful. It is great for making chicken salad sandwiches or for adding to soup or any other food item.  The meat flakes into small pieces easily, so you may not want to add it to your soup stock until just before you are ready to serve it.  It would also make a good filling for enchiladas, tortillas or quesadillas.  I have no problems at all with the taste or texture of this product.  It is appealing when you open the can and it would work well for many recipes or quick meals or snacks.  For those who don't like tuna, it's a great alternative.<br />Basically, it's chicken when you need it ready to go, and it is a good source of protein with very little fat.  One can contains 5 servings with each serving containing 50 calories, 9 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat, 25 mg of cholesterol (8% of DV), 1 gm of carbohydrate and 260 grams of sodium(does that include the broth?).  If sodium is a concern, consider adjusting the amount of salt that you add to your recipe or maybe you could even lightly rinse the drained chicken in a strainer.<br />It's certainly better than buying luncheon meat and keeping it for too long!  It's fresh when you need it.  I have a couple of cans stored in my refrigerator now. This chicken contains no MSG and no artificial flavor - just less than 2% food starch and sodium phosphates.(okay sodium phosphates may not appeal to some)<br />Update:<br />Just opened another can and added it to a healthy variation of macaroni and cheese.<br />I haven't tried the concoction yet, but the chicken looked wonderful when I opened the can - appealing light pink color and chunky bits of meat like baked chicken breast.",update  please note per my information below product description and photo are no longer accurate  the product has a sealed lid not a poptop lid and the amount of protein and sodium have changed  see below for the correct information  i have notified amazon of this error  somehow  grams of protein have been lost from the can contentsbr br i purchased the  ounce can of swanson white premium chunk chicken breast on sale at cvs  buy one get one free for   per can  this large size can pack works out to be a better deal even though its not a sale price and subscribing to purchase this product on a schedule reduces the price per can even morebr i am wondering if the person who commented that the meat was a mixture of white and dark meat ordered or received the wrong product since there is a similar product available for a lower price that is a blend of white and dark meat  this  ounce net weight can contains all white meat and just the right amount of broth thats easy to drain off or use  the chicken looks appealing and it tastes mild and flavorful it is great for making chicken salad sandwiches or for adding to soup or any other food item  the meat flakes into small pieces easily so you may not want to add it to your soup stock until just before you are ready to serve it  it would also make a good filling for enchiladas tortillas or quesadillas  i have no problems at all with the taste or texture of this product  it is appealing when you open the can and it would work well for many recipes or quick meals or snacks  for those who dont like tuna its a great alternativebr basically its chicken when you need it ready to go and it is a good source of protein with very little fat  one can contains  servings with each serving containing  calories  grams of protein  gram of fat  mg of cholesterol  of dv  gm of carbohydrate and  grams of sodiumdoes that include the broth  if sodium is a concern consider adjusting the amount of salt that you add to your recipe or maybe you could even lightly rinse the drained chicken in a strainerbr its certainly better than buying luncheon meat and keeping it for too long  its fresh when you need it  i have a couple of cans stored in my refrigerator now this chicken contains no msg and no artificial flavor  just less than  food starch and sodium phosphatesokay sodium phosphates may not appeal to somebr updatebr just opened another can and added it to a healthy variation of macaroni and cheesebr i havent tried the concoction yet but the chicken looked wonderful when i opened the can  appealing light pink color and chunky bits of meat like baked chicken breast,positive,positive
"First the delivery service was great and arrived a few days before the estimated time. The package was in good condition and my children liked the taste. I think it is one of the best alternatives to peanut butter with added nutritional benefits and allergen safe. Unlike regular peanut butter exerted to high roasting temperatures producing unwanted free radicals, this brand is sure stand the test if they continue upholding their manufacturing principles. One thing you may need to do is to thoroughly mix the butter before use since at the bottom it's too hard and the top too light.

"I purchased two bottles of this stuff.

I haven't changed anything in my diet to explain this sudden increase so I do believe it was the use of the new pills.<br /><br />I think the first bottle may have been older and so the capsules may have lost their potency.

"This peach flavored diet tea by Snapple is extremely refreshing after a long summer's day! It's truly a diet tea--there are zero calories. It's best served chilled; and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right. Snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves; there's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring. They use filtered water as well. This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.<br /><br />If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is perfect for a hot summer's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle.

"The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.",the first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products if you do not want to read that part skip down to the bottom and there is the review of the stash teas onlybr br br br a couple of years ago i had a physical and my doctor told me that my triglycerides were high i was a serious soda drinker sometimes as many as  cans per day not diet so i decided i needed to start drinking something healthlier i gravitated toward green tea because i like it i averaged   liter bottles per day for  years i also averaged about  cans of soda per daybr br i recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down they doubled they were over  over  is considered high i about had a heart attack right there now i am not an overweight person and have had a fairly high motabolism but i have started to create a belly i call it a dr pepper belly because that is my favorite soda i do not drink alcohol of any kind i am telling all of this to you because all of my other tests came in within normal levels including all other aspects to my cholesterolbr br i did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products the excess sugar consumed in this case can be turned into trigylcerides i looked at what i was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me what i found shocked me the  liter bottles of green tea has more sugar in it than a can of soda i checked several different manufacturers of green tea and i found them all to have about the same amount of sugarbr br i concluded that between my morning coffee green tea bottles and soda i was consuming over  grams of sugar a week  or about  callories of sugar a week just in drinksbr br br br i was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products i personally do not have the time or patience to use tea bags so i was interested in the tea powders i ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it and i loved it i then proceeded to buy the other  flavors of the green tea powders and love them alsobr br there are  flavors that do not have sugar added so i use a few drops of stevia glycerite to sweeten the drink it does not take a lotbr br the best thing is that the tea powders cost about  or less than the bottled green teas i use to drinkbr br br br to end on a personal note i have altered my drinking habits and now drink  liter of the tea powder drink and  liter of water per day i still drink  can of dr pepper on the weekend but that is it i have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills i have lost about  lbs and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeksbr br i hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is,positive,positive

"I drink plenty of water when I'm active but I don't like any type of sports drinks due to them causing me heartburn. I picked up a couple packs of these at REI ($2 ea.) the other day since I was already considering a case purchase from Amazon. I enjoyed them on my last bike ride and I feel like they helped replace valuable electrolytes that plain water just won't deliver.<br /><br />The beans themselves: Delicious. I doubt I could tell the difference in taste OR texture between these and regular candy jelly beans. I recommend drinking water while consuming these beans. If you eat two or three without water you may notice (like I did) the beans settle a bit heavy. The water really facilitates the electrolyte/carbo distribution throughout the bloodstream.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you have an aversion to sports drinks for any reason, these sport beans offer an excellent source of electrolytes and some carbs. I feel like they help make the most of my water and my water helps make the most of them. Like another reviewer, I did NOT find any measurable or significant gain in energy but feel like they help balance valuable electrolytes. The Jelly Belly Sport Beans will be with me from now on when I'm working out but if you are looking for an energy boost along the lines of ""5 hour energy"" you may want to try something else. Jelly Belly does have a caffeinated version of this product but I have not tried it yet.

"With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.<br /><br />Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch.",with the amazon mom discount this is cheaper than in stores unless theres a sale  it regularly goes on sale at kroger publix and other grocery stores for around  cents a jar  i wish there were other earths best fruit varieties available on amazon at this price  no problems with breakage during shipping for me but i found the packaging annoying  in general though i think earths best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what youre getting  organic nongmo baby food delivered to your door step  as a single mom in a rural community going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hasslebr br earths best is definitely better tasting and smelling than nonorganic foods like gerber  the textures are good but i had to stay on st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all nd foods made my son gag  i had a similar issue graduating from nd foods to rd foods  sprout baby food however is the best quality ive tried for freshness aroma and taste  it reminds me of pureed fresh produce  while ive seen it in winndixie for the same price as earths best its much more expensive on amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online  im going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it but ill probably always keep a few jars of earths best to get by in a pinch,positive,positive

"I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging.

"I first tried this brand and blend as part of a k-cup sampler pack. I was immediately in love with this k-cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast, and this more than fits the bill. It has the smoothest taste of the 6 or 7 medium roasts/breakfast blends that I have tried so far. If you like high octane, this is not going to be your favorite k-cup, but you would certainly enjoy it as a nice change of pace every now and then. My benchmark for a good k-cup is that I can use the large (9oz) setting on my Keurig and still get a cup of real coffee, not coffee flavored water. This passes the test with flying colors. If I need a kick in the pants to get out the door in the morning, I drop down to the 7oz setting for a slightly stronger brew. I like the fact that the taste remains smooth, even if I make it a little stronger.

"I received one 10-Ounce packet of Lamb and Barley dog treats from the Vine program. The treats are fairly large but they are creased and can easily be broken into two treats. My Dobie is a big boy and eating the treat unbroken is his preference. Actually, eating anything is his preference. He doesn't really ""eat"" in the true sense of the word as much as he ""inhales"" anything he considers edible. The treats have a very slight odor but sufficient for him to gulp them down in a NY minute. He would never be mistaken for a picky eater.<br /><br />Like most dogs I have ever seen or owned he is not driven by a gourmet mentality but performs more like a vacuum cleaner when it comes to absorbing anything he deems worthy of ingesting.

"I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don't have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all.",i am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because i never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar  i really enjoy the starbucks via instant coffee  but i drink so much it is rather expensive so i thought i would give this a try  both my wife and i were pleasantly surprised with the taste  i dont think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable  i bought my first  pack at my local grocery store for about   that seemed a little high but i figured i would check online to find the best price  as i started calculating all of the online prices they are charging about  bucks for the  count  i would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper  so you dont have to do the math     per single  online price      shipping not calculated in  looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier you can get a case of  boxes for  no sales tax and free shippingsounds like a great deal   x    singles so      per single  the most expensive at all,positive,positive

"First I want to say my dog is a carnivore, he primarily eats raw meat. I do allow him many treats other than carrots but he will jump at the chance to eat anything I toss at my chickens.  For that reason I wanted to try Newman's own because it is organic and has all the good things a dog should have, and I felt he should be able to have something good for him other than meat.<br /><br />When Amazon offered this to me to review for all of you. I jumped at the chance for my dog to give it a try. When this arrived it came in a large bag, I thought this would have been a tiny little bag of treats, it was not,  the treats inside were very large 2-1/4"" long and about 2"" wide and about 1/2' thick. It also had a nice crease in the middle to brak it in half if  you choose to give a smaller treat. As most treats they smell awful but I guess a dog would like that.<br /><br />I gave my dog, a constantly hungry Black Pug, a choice of his frozen treat in one hand and Newman's own in the other, he took a while but chose his treat.<br /><br />I then gave him Newman's own treat and he took it but he sniffed at it for awhile.  Now he knows what it is. I then sat down at my laptop and he jumped up to be with me, he stared at the treat and I moved it toward him and nothing, I gave the OK command and he looked at it,  I had to pick it up and give it too him. Now it is a few minutes later, he is sitting here, the treat is on my leg and he is looking at it, oops just jumped off.<br />My dog, who will eat just about everything, just walked away from this treat.

Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA"">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.""",these honey dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty tangy sweet and crunchy other brands ive tried use too much mustard flavor which overpowers the honey dijon pairingbr br these chips make a great side dish on a bbq plate with baked beans coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat naturally they also go down great with beerbr br as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherbr br i also recommend these other kettle chips flavors a href chips sea salt  vinegara and a href chips spicy thaiabr br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly,positive,positive

"If you're like me, then you LOVE peanut butter so much that you can't really keep it in the house.  The 'real' stuff is so full of fat and salt and hydrogenated oils that its yumminess comes at a pretty high cost.  PB2 is a great alternative.  It's not exactly the same taste as a commercial product, but it's close enough that when you put with the other things you would normally eat you will not notice much of a difference, and if you do, just imagine how much fat you're not eating!<br /><br />One of the great advantages of this product is that you can make it whatever consistency you want, just by altering the amount of water you add in the mixing process.  I find that makes it a very versatile product for cooking when I want to make a peanut sauce, or when I put it on apples and want it a bit thicker than the standard ratio delivers.<br /><br />Also, the fact that is has to be mixed up short circuits the spoon-to-mouth pattern that made it impossible for me to keep the 'real' stuff in the house.<br /><br />The only real down side is that because it's a powder there is no 'crunchy' version, but I suppose you could chop up peanuts and mix them in if you wanted to.",if youre like me then you love peanut butter so much that you cant really keep it in the house  the real stuff is so full of fat and salt and hydrogenated oils that its yumminess comes at a pretty high cost  pb is a great alternative  its not exactly the same taste as a commercial product but its close enough that when you put with the other things you would normally eat you will not notice much of a difference and if you do just imagine how much fat youre not eatingbr br one of the great advantages of this product is that you can make it whatever consistency you want just by altering the amount of water you add in the mixing process  i find that makes it a very versatile product for cooking when i want to make a peanut sauce or when i put it on apples and want it a bit thicker than the standard ratio deliversbr br also the fact that is has to be mixed up short circuits the spoontomouth pattern that made it impossible for me to keep the real stuff in the housebr br the only real down side is that because its a powder there is no crunchy version but i suppose you could chop up peanuts and mix them in if you wanted to,positive,positive

"Well I bought these to have a ""Food Tripping Party"" with my wife. I had a spread before us of lemons, limes, strawberries, blackberries, oranges, and grapefruit. We both started with half a pill each as per the reviews here. I then took a bite of a lemon. I guess is was sweeter but not by much, though I was able to eat it. It was like a sweet + tart food which I guess is because of the acid in the fruit. I then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one. I tried again. It made the lemons bearable but not super sweet. You would not be able to eat an entire be happy. I went onto the other fruits and the same thing. You could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste. My wife said this, ""Well it makes it so you can eat lemons, but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day?"" I'm disappointed BUT the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife. I'll pawn these off on friends and see what they say.

"These pork rinds fry in their own fat rather than having to be deep fried which is a lifesaver if you like pork rinds.

Not particularly healthy, but it's much healthier than the mexican bagged varieties.<br /><br />Since we don't have a microwave (oh my god, how do we get by without one?!), we toast them in a toaster oven on a baking tray for about 10-15 minutes at 375F-400F.

"The bars are about 3/4th the size of a Clif bar and have the same sort of consistency. The smell of the coconut is pretty powerful when you open the package and the bars themselves don't really have a decent taste. I don't know if this is because it's gluten-free or what, but it tastes sort of like a dry tasteless oatmeal cookie. The chocolate didn't help add to the flavor.

"There is much confusion about tomatoes, and shopping on-line in this case adds to the complexity.  These are not the best tomatoes offered at the time of this writing.  The Strianese are hands down the best.  My local store sells them.  I have been using them for fifteen years.  But they are significantly more expensive and the shipping is brutal.  No Prime shipping with them.  I use these specific Cento when I am not home.  It all depends on how much your sauce means to you.<br /><br />But you need to know what you are buying.  These Cento tomatoes are 1) San Marzano sauce tomatoes; 2) they are D.O.P. certified 3) and this point is often overlooked, they are from the Sarnese Nocerino.  They are the second best in terms of absolute flavor.  Bright from proper acid, deep from proper natural salt/sugar balance.  You probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower, or do it yourself and have no day job.  Cento sells many others, much cheaper, that are not these.<br /><br />The price per can is good.  The best deal is if you have Amazon Prime and get regular shipments.  I get three large batches per case, enough to feed the mob that forms on sauce day.<br /><br />Most people are happy with the many good canned tomatoes, especially when you look at the poor genetically engineered ersatz ""fresh"" tomatoes at the supermarket.

"These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or ""best by"" date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June ""use by"" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they're roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't seem to specify ""use by"" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.

"The Switch Kiwi Berry is 8.3 ounces and has 135 calories, 15 mg of Sodium, 34 g of carbs (11% of daily value), 33 g of sugar and oh yeah 100% of your Vitamin C daily value.

"The Switch Kiwi Berry was a good drink. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but not by much. One serving size was 8.3 fluid ounces.

"I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it.",i have a goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side so i started researching dog foods i found that what he was on was not really good for him the second ingredient was ground corn and i found out that shouldnt be in the dog food at all its all filler nondigestiblefiller in filler out through this surfing and sifting of information what was good explanation of terms and eager for any information i could get and then pursue i ended with canidae all life stages dry there were others under consideration but considering cost balanced with good nutrition supplements included in the food and availability i opted for canidaebr br of the top five ingredients before the fat in this case chicken fat three are animal protein meal chicken turkey and lamb meals the other two ingredients are brown and white rice good easily digestible grains my understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process meaning when your ingredient list  lists chicken first that is precooked weight after cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking the ingredient list would not come out looking as good chicken might not be as high in the list if a chicken meal is listed they start with the same grade of chicken generally speaking however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down this is the same for any meal protein a meal protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down the water cooked out of it so a meal protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein which wont be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together five lbs of chicken may end up to be lbs however lbs of chicken meal stays lbsthis is made up example for clarity not based on any math or science the ingredients go on to list additional herring meal vitamins probiotics for good intestinal health natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couplebr br beforehand riley was less than excited about meal time he would pick at it almost from the beginning walk away come back  a little more eating and allot of drinking now he eats itbr br a big benefit and another part of the reason for a search is the reduction in feces he was going  or  times a day and no small amount we are down to two  four timesday so far improvement in condition of feces also firmer more normal coloring less of it it seems like his body is getting more out of his foodbr br he seems to have an improved activity level his playfulness is increased but not hyper by any means just healthier perhaps calms right down on command even around the other dogsbr br so far so good for this change i have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change but so far so good he doesnt shed so im watching carefully for any new hair loss i wont wait it if occurs i will take him off i certainly would say conditionally this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality foodbr br  its been about  months now on canidae  riley is still looking good  no sudden hair loss healthy energetic eating as i typestill happy with this decision and am still using it,positive,neutral

As the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste. Granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys (high fructose syrup and coloring)but the taste is mediocre. This is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste. If you are a health food junkie you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste. Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds.

"I was exhausted, hot, and dehydrated when I spotted this in a concourse store at JFK airport.  I was about to get on a 6 hour flight and water sounded too unsatisfying - but juice sounded too heavy.<br />I'd heard the rumblings about coconut water so I looked to see if I liked any of the flavor options - I can't stand mango and just about everyone adds it.

"I have little doubt that the Blue Icicle will get the job done with a Shure SM-58, or similar ""dynamic"" microphone.  But its claim that it will convert any ""condenser"" mic, even one that normally requires XLR connection and phantom power, into a ""plug 'n play"" USB mic should not be taken at face value.  I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion.  In the long run, he would have been ahead (in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic.  As it is, the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market (the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics, despite what you may have read).  So, if necessary, give it a try--and more than one.  But make sure there are return privileges.",i have little doubt that the blue icicle will get the job done with a shure sm or similar dynamic microphone  but its claim that it will convert any condenser mic even one that normally requires xlr connection and phantom power into a plug n play usb mic should not be taken at face value  i say this because i have an acquaintance with the original audio technica at condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion  in the long run he would have been ahead in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks by purchasing the at usb mic  as it is the blue icicle is probably the best such converter on the market the comparably priced lightsnake cable will not convert condenser mics despite what you may have read  so if necessary give it a tryand more than one  but make sure there are return privileges,positive,positive

I did a video taste test with 3 treats (this one, the chicken popper, and a regular milkbone biscuit) expecting her to take the popper first, but then see how fast she came back for the Newman's Own Dog treat.  To my actual surprise she took the Newman's Own first.  This was the first time I ever offered it to her.  I usually give her a few treats in the morning and she smells them all and grabs her favorite first.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more.  Check out the video.

"We have a tiny little 8 lb maltese, and we got him the mini size bag of these.

"I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.

A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste.

"Glutino gluten free crackers are probably the closest thing you can get to Ritz or club-like crackers. These crackers are crisp without feeling stale and have a nice crunch that I miss with regular crackers.

The flavor it subtle enough that you can put virtually anything on top. Be warned they get stale very quickly so keep them in a zip-lock bag even if they are in the box.

"Celestial Seasonings is one of my favorites, if not my favorite, brands of tea.  Fruit herbal teas are my favorite type.  I love this sampler box of herbal teas.  The five types of tea, in order of my favorite flavors, are: Country Peach Passion, Black Cherry Berry, True Blueberry, Raspberry Zinger, and Wild Berry Zinger.<br /><br />I love tea, especially when eating certain foods, but also I love it all by itself.  I love tea with most all kinds of foods, especially cornbread or country foods.  It also goes good with most all other ethnic foods.<br /><br />I usually drink my tea plain (no sugar).  Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.  She might have gotten her feelings hurt.

"It certainly served as a wonderfully refreshing break on a hot day. I enjoyed the taste a great deal, which is rare for drinks with no added sugar. It had just the right amount of sweetness, and overall it tasted a bit like a lollipop - tart, sweet, and sour. I don't necessarily believe that a quick ingestion of lots of Vitamin C makes you feel better by any mechanism other than a placebo, but needless to say this drink has this vitamin in excess, which certainly doesn't hurt. 130 cals is a bit much if you're trying to limit your caloric intake, but then again it would hardly be organic if it had artificial sweeteners and 5% juice.

"This is the best Cajun spice my wife and I have found anywhere, ever.  We have been using it for more than ten years.  It goes great on all sorts of things -- chicken, beef, pork, fish, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, or fried), baked potato, etc.  Not only is it a very good combination of spices, it is also ground fine and mixed well.  Whenever we fry something in batter or breading, Luzianne's Cajun Seasoning usually finds its way into the mix.<br /><br />We've tried ""Slap Ya Momma"" and other cajun spices, but those tend to be too coarse.  Instead of tasting a blend of spices, you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt, filling your mouth with the taste of salt, then a nugget of pepper, filling your mouth with the taste of pepper, etc.  Luzianne's is definitely the superior implementation.<br /><br />We recently ran out of it, and to our dismay Safeway has stopped carrying this product, which is why we have tried other brands.

"I bought this for my last birthday, thanks to a gift card I was sent.  I should say that for it's price, this is a perfectly decent brand of white truffle oil.

If you like a garlicky white truffle flavor, this is a good brand and can even make a good gift, depending upon your budget.<br /><br />There is a bit of confusion.  When I read about this on-line, it says it is an infusion.  Other places both on-line and by the manufacturers say it is ""truffle-essence.""  There is a world of difference between these two things.  An infusion is easily the best way to try truffle oils, truly meaning that genuine truffles were infused with a high quality olive oil.  An ""essence"", on the other hand, generally means it's been made to taste of white-truffles, perhaps even using very synthetic methods.  This brand could be both and as a general rule I trust Urbani products.  Still, for a simple and less expensive oil used for general cooking, this is good for its price-point.

"I'm new to food allergies.  My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he's still breastfed, I had to drastically alter my diet.<br /><br />Before learning about this brand, I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal.  So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them.  It's got pretty good texture, taste and heft.

"I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.

"I've been eating Nishiki (?) jasmine white rice for many years, and thought I'd try this as it is healthier. I was very pleasantly surprised - it tasted great. I was concerned it wouldn't cook properly in my programmable Zojirushi 3 cup rice cooker but it comes out great on both the regular and quick cooking settings. (I haven't tried it in my bigger neurofuzzy cooker but assume it would be as good or better). It does seem a little more sensitive to amount of water than regular white rice - adding too much makes it mushier.<br /><br />I think it's the wheat and rye berries that make it delicious, so getting the brown/wild rice mix at Whole Foods and mixing in some wheat and rye berries would probably be just as tasty and less expensive.",ive been eating nishiki  jasmine white rice for many years and thought id try this as it is healthier i was very pleasantly surprised  it tasted great i was concerned it wouldnt cook properly in my programmable zojirushi  cup rice cooker but it comes out great on both the regular and quick cooking settings i havent tried it in my bigger neurofuzzy cooker but assume it would be as good or better it does seem a little more sensitive to amount of water than regular white rice  adding too much makes it mushierbr br i think its the wheat and rye berries that make it delicious so getting the brownwild rice mix at whole foods and mixing in some wheat and rye berries would probably be just as tasty and less expensive,positive,positive

"I'm constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price. Often, when I do, they are hard as rocks, dry, and practically unusable.

"The first sip gave a pleasing flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />When trying the kiwi flavor, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that other flavors also have acerola in them).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink...

"Switch promises ""A perfect balance between juice and carbonation"" and it does live up to that as it delivers a fresh burst of stawberry and kiwi (the kiwi could have been a little stronger) and less carbonation then your regular sodas.

"We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free.

"Sweet Leaf Stevia Extract is powdered, pure stevia.  There are supposedly 400 servings (1/40th of a teaspoon) in a .4 ounce container, so it works out to be a fairly inexpensive natural, non-sugar sweetener and dietary supplement - less than 2 cents per serving and 1.5 cents per serving with Subscribe and Save - though it will take you a long time to use up one container, let alone four.  This extract has the sweetness of 300 - 360 times that of sugar, is a Kosher product, and it contains no additives.  Also the .4 ounce container is fairly small and has a shaker top, so it is easy to carry with you and use if you are away from home.  You could even attach a very small spoon with a rubber band to the container if you wanted to be even more precise with your serving sizes.  I started out using this in tea and I am now using it in my coffee as well.  It mixes fairly well in hot drinks.  It's easy to get used to the flavor in tea, but may take you some time in coffee. I think that it's worth it to take the time to get used to the taste.  The end result is that for every teaspoon of sugar or serving of artificial sweetener that you ingest in your coffee or tea during the day, you will be substituting a dietary supplement that has been shown to be healthy to your gums and in some studies to lower high blood pressure.  Every teaspoon of white granulated sugar has 4 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of sugar and 15 calories.  If you normally have 5 teaspoons of sugar during the day in your hot drinks, you would be saving 75 calories per day - a good portion of the recommended 100 calorie per day reduction to help with long-term weight loss.  The flavor of this pure extract compares very favorably with that of ground stevia leaf (blehhh!) which if you add it to tea will just float on the surface.  Also as compared with Truvia or other stevia plus other sweetener products, it is considerably less expensive and the taste is pure - not multi-layered.  If you want to enhance the flavor and it doesn't conflict with your diet regimen, consider adding a squirt of honey or a dash of table sugar to your beverage.  I am looking forward to perfecting a hot cocoa recipe.  Chocolate and cocoa seem to mask flavors very effectively.  I am not sure how to use stevia for baking.  That will take some experimentation and most likely require combining stevia with other wholesome sweeteners.<br />In all fairness, I have only tried Truvia once in tea, and I found that it had an almost cooling effect on my tongue and considerably less sweetness than stevia.  Many sweeteners come in single serving packets, and as a result they are considerably more expensive per serving.

"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.

"I love mangoes and I love matcha, so this is the perfect combo for me! However, this isn't your plain old mango tea taste.

"Today I tried the spaghetti Tofu Shirataki noodles by House Foods. I would give these noodles a five stars if it weren't for the pre-preparation that is involved. I found these at my local Asian mart for about $2.00.<br /><br />First you must rinse these noodles well because the liquid they come in smells like a lake (you should prepare yourself for the smell). Second, you need to lay out the noodles on paper towels and press down removing as much of the liquid as possible before use.<br /><br />Next I fried them on high heat with a small amount of oil and butter. After a few minutes I then added my frozen stir-fry vegetable medley. I then added some broth, soy sauce, and finally a thickener such as corn starch. Stir it up, bring to a boil, and turn it off.<br /><br />Really it tasted great- very much like the ramen noodles.

Coast but friends living in California, traveling through that area, and indeed..every time I make a visit, bottles of this stuff wind up on my shelf.<br /><br />I use this tasty sauce on just about any appropriate food item.  It is a condiment I keep on the table during every meal.  Now don't think you are just getting a hot sauce here...no, no, no!  The flavor is what makes this the best.  The only sauce I have ever tasted that came near it was from two bottles of liquid heaven I purchased in Jamaica which is made and bottled by a single family their and is almost impossible to get.  This product though is almost its equal.<br /><br />The sauce is smooth with a garlic taste most certainly, but not overwhelming.  No edgy jalapeno after taste is present (Jalapeno are not my favorite, that's for sure). This product, as one reviewer her put it, does not focus simply on the burn as most of these concoctions do.  I am not sure what all goes in the stuff, but what ever it is, it works.<br /><br />This is the primary ingredient for a BBQ sauce I make (sorry, old family secret) and of course it works right out of the bottle on almost all meat, fish and many, many vegetables.  I personally do not like any sort of sauce on my eggs but I have many good friends that do and they rave about this stuff every time they stay over and I fix breakfast for them.<br /><br />If this stuff is ever offered nationally, I hope they do not fool around with the process too much.

With the plethora of sweetened iced tea k-cups, it's great to have one with the good, clean and fresh taste of unsweetened tea.

"My wife has a difficult time getting enough iron, and supplements are very hard on her stomach.  With 70% of the USRDA of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses, she can very easily get the iron she needs.  This is not in any way hard on her stomach, either.

"I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.

"When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love.

"I have been feeding Blue Buffalo foods to my Golden Retriever, who is almost 3 years old, since I brought him home as a 7 week old puppy. As a veterinary technician, I am aware of many common health problems in the breed, allergies being one of them. Knowing that corn and other fillers can be the cause of allergies, I wanted a food that only used the best ingredients. I looked into many different brands that were reported to use quality ingredients. Blue Buffalo, it turned out, was the only such brand that was readily available in my area.<br /><br />The breeder had been feeding Eukanuba Puppy food, so I started ""Bruce"" on a mixture of the Eukanuba Puppy and the Blue Buffalo Puppy. He would actually pick out the Eukanuba and only eat the B.B. kibbles (one of my coworkers reports that her Dachshund puppy did the same when she switched him to B.B.). So, I ultimately gave up on trying to mix the foods and just fed straight B.B. He would, sometimes, pick out those ""Lifesource Bits"" and leave them scattered all over the floor but is now a voracious eater and is not picky at all.<br /><br />As he is now an adult, I have been feeding him a variety of the B.B. flavors. I started him with the B.B. Large Breed formula, then switched to the Fish and Sweet Potato, then the Lamb and so on. I am hoping that by rotating the formulas, I will be able to prevent or, at least, cut down on any food allergies and provide him with a healthy variety of nutrients. Since he quickly scarfs down any food I put down for him, I can't see that he has any preference to flavor. He loves them all.<br /><br />I can report that, to date, ""Bruce"" has been an extremely healthy dog. His coat is thick and shiny, his eyes are clear, and he is a very solid 95 Lbs. Everyone that sees him oohs and aahs over how handsome he is. I know a lot of that is genetics but I'm sure Blue Buffalo had a little something to do with it, as well.",i have been feeding blue buffalo foods to my golden retriever who is almost  years old since i brought him home as a  week old puppy as a veterinary technician i am aware of many common health problems in the breed allergies being one of them knowing that corn and other fillers can be the cause of allergies i wanted a food that only used the best ingredients i looked into many different brands that were reported to use quality ingredients blue buffalo it turned out was the only such brand that was readily available in my areabr br the breeder had been feeding eukanuba puppy food so i started bruce on a mixture of the eukanuba puppy and the blue buffalo puppy he would actually pick out the eukanuba and only eat the bb kibbles one of my coworkers reports that her dachshund puppy did the same when she switched him to bb so i ultimately gave up on trying to mix the foods and just fed straight bb he would sometimes pick out those lifesource bits and leave them scattered all over the floor but is now a voracious eater and is not picky at allbr br as he is now an adult i have been feeding him a variety of the bb flavors i started him with the bb large breed formula then switched to the fish and sweet potato then the lamb and so on i am hoping that by rotating the formulas i will be able to prevent or at least cut down on any food allergies and provide him with a healthy variety of nutrients since he quickly scarfs down any food i put down for him i cant see that he has any preference to flavor he loves them allbr br i can report that to date bruce has been an extremely healthy dog his coat is thick and shiny his eyes are clear and he is a very solid  lbs everyone that sees him oohs and aahs over how handsome he is i know a lot of that is genetics but im sure blue buffalo had a little something to do with it as well,positive,positive

If you overcook, they will end up tasting closer to the bagged taste you are trying to avoid.  Still better than bagged though.

"My package arrived today and being a chocolate/coconut fanatic and hungry at the time, I immediately ate one and shared one with my husband as well for his viewpoint.<br /><br />Pros: Pretty yummy, especially for a health food product. Rich in coconut and oat. It feels as though you are eating more than you are, has a satisfying effect.<br /><br />Cons: The wrapper is much bigger than the product, causing my first reaction to be, ""this is it???"" But like I said, it was filling.. but it needs a bit more chocolate.

"I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the ""special"" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as ""hypnotic"" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart.",i buy a big tub of these for my dog about every  months he loves them i do mix them in with other treats so he does not get a steady diet of them they are given out as the special treat being one notch above a standard wheatfree dog cookiebr br while these are great treats they are not as hypnotic as real meat is and given the price and how inexpensive some goodquality meat is at the grocery store if you truly want to mesmerize your dog go with real meat its pretty funny that so many of us are paying  for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about  a poundbr br however most of us dont want slimy hands all day so we use treats i use these out when walking my dog and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes i like them because they are feather light but just dont get them wet or they turn to mush my dogs interest in them after they get wet goes down a lotbr br i do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized but they arent too hard to break apart,positive,positive

"My Maggie L-I-V-E-S for Her Treatie Time<br /><br />Every evening, after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime, it turns into ""Treatie-Time."" Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to ""earn"" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the ""girls"" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my ""grand-dog"" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a ""luxury"" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their ""treatie-time.""<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!",my maggie lives for her treatie timebr br every evening after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime it turns into treatietime both of my girls lucille and maggie are allowed two treats or sometimes three each if they really beg they have to sit or down or do something special to earn their treatie but its a special time for usbr br i value my dogs health as im sure you do i want them to live a long time and have a troublefree existence  no scratchy skin allergies etc therefore ive explored using organic treats and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery i must tell you that the girls were underwhelmed with those treats despite their healthy ingredientsbr br therefore when i was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for barksters i was ambivalent organic treats havent been very well received in my household in the past but i was game to try them againbr br i believe in organic treats but if the girls dont eat them its really money down the drain especially since were not depending upon the treats for total nutrition im also concerned with treats being of the the lowcalorie variety i was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuity treats contained over  calories in each one thats terriblebr br as i opened the two packages of barksters one was sweet potato and chicken krisps and the other was brown rice and beef krisps i was glad to see two things on the packagingbr br the treats are made in the good ole us of america this is important especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in chinabr br the treats are wheat free and gluten freebr br the second is most important for my granddog dutchy the siberian husky ever since hes been a pup hes struggled with digestive issues our vet recommended that he have a glutenfree diet which has helped him tremendously we dont want to ruin his digestion with treatsbr br as we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy georgia sunday afternoon i broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be i was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes  very puffy  and waferlike instead of a biscuit and i must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs they couldnt get enough of thembr br the wafers tended to break but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group they didnt mind if it was broken in two that just meant two treats  bonusbr br the treats cost approximately  per box which contained  ounces which seems pricey but since its a luxury item i can go with the price i was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats especially since they didnt look like the ones theyre used to getting for their treatietimebr br id highly recommend that you try barksters,positive,positive

This is an item to use sparingly, brushed on grilled meat or vegetables, or mixed into sauces and marinades.<br /><br />I had bought a tube of this brand at a specialty store in Berkeley, but was not able to find it again. The other brand I could find was adequate, but the texture was too pasty and the flavor not so fresh. I was delighted to find Le Cabanon offered for sale here. The shipping price for one tube was in my opinion prohibitive, but the product stays fresh indefinitely in the sealed tubes, so I had no qualms about buying six at a time.

Love these things!!<br /><br />Additional comment:  In reading the reviews I see some complaints about leakage, etc... one trick I have come to rely on is NOT to fill the kup all the way to the top with the coffee.  You need to leave some room at t the top so that the lid isn't touching the coffee inside (maybe a little less than 1/2cm from the top rim).  When I follow this protocol, I get a perfect cup every time.  When I fill it too high, I end up with leakage.

"For health reasons, I try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods. I love tapioca but it's 100% carbs with no nutritional value.

"Instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans, I received a cardboard box, with a plastic bag full of jelly beans.  They were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag.  On the box there was a typed label that said:""green apple jelly  belly 16 oz. new"".  There was no ingredient list, company logo, allergen information, or anything else you'd expect to find on food packages. I certainly wouldn't eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie.  I did ask that it be shipped next day, so maybe they couldn't take the time to package it in the advertised tub.

"Heat 8-10 oz 2% or whole milk, not quite to boiling, in your microwave. Add ~1-1/4 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Mocha Hot Choc powder + ~1-1/8 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Hazelnut Hot choc powder, stirring to fully mix. Now add ~3/4 oz Christian Brothers VS Brandy. (Optionally) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve.<br />Notes: Not to be a brand whore, but Christian Bros (VS, not the more expensive VSOP) is the only brandy I've found to really have the right profile for this recipe. Exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste. Non-fat and 1% milk are NOT recommended. The brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note. I've for many years used a 1.0 Mocha + 1.5 Hazelnut ratio, but lately the Mocha product hasn't seemed as intense, so I've adjusted.

"If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best.  It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their ""100% satisfaction guarantee"". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item ""powdered"".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products.",if you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index you will see that erythritol is one of the best  it is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like xylitol  but unlike xylitol it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating gaseous effects  if you dont need a sweetener without blood sugar effects you can look at brown rice syrup or agave since they have a very low effect on blood sugar  if you want no blood sugar effects at all id recommend this since it has a very nice taste like sugar with no aftertaste  stevia is another option but is very strong and has a less appealing taste  if you use even a bit too much stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste  this is not true of erythritolbr br i would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only  as sweet as sugar  you can spike it with stevia to make up the difference if you like stevia  it doesnt take much to add to get it a lot sweeter  you should shake it up really well before using thoughbr br note if you want to buy this particular item i discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address i would avoid emeraldforest though because the erythritol i got from them had a very strange foul smell  like mothballs  and had a faint aftertaste that was the same their customer service was very nasty when i called to return it in spite of their  satisfaction guarantee i am sticking with now foods from now onbr br also  it is a bit misleading that they call this particular item powdered  regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability  what they mean here though is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol  it is still a grain however  i buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals but both are good products,positive,positive

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:09 Mins<br /><br /></span>My eight-year-old son volunteered to try Nong Shim's new flavor, spicy chicken. I made a video interview of him eating the noodles for dinner, after he came home from judo practice (hungry).<br /><br />Our family enjoys Nong Shim instant noodles. We stock our pantry every autumn with bowls of ramen, yakisoba and udon. Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea.<br /><br />The package design is getting better. The endorsement by Professional Chefs (a 2011 Chef's Best Award) is easier to read and three colored boxes in the lower right corner note that the noodles have no MSG added, there's 30% less sodium than their regular product and that the noodles have 0 grams of trans fat.<br /><br />I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your instant noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />Earlier this year, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, executive editor at Serious Eats, posted ""Ramen Hacks: 30+ Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles."" I highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you will never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodles.<br /><br />I distilled his tips down to these four bullet points:<br /><br />* Simple Add-ins -- Miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, harrisa, vinegar and ponzu.<br /><br />* Vegetation -- Baby spinach, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cabbage, watercress, and scallions ""should wilt in a matter of seconds.""<br /><br />* Eggs -- Hard boiled, soft boiled, the egg-drop method, poached eggs and fried eggs.<br /><br />* Simple Simmered Meat -- Thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates.<br /><br />Instant noodles available at Amazon that our family eats and recommends:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOX6RA"">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MP136A"">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Kimchi</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171FB7I"">Nong Shim Beef and Ginger Bowl</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK5A"">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Bowl</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDFQG"">Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba Noodles</a><br /><br />In many cases you can sign up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program for additional savings and convenience.",span classtiny length  minsbr br spanmy eightyearold son volunteered to try nong shims new flavor spicy chicken i made a video interview of him eating the noodles for dinner after he came home from judo practice hungrybr br our family enjoys nong shim instant noodles we stock our pantry every autumn with bowls of ramen yakisoba and udon nong shim is the leading brand of ramyoen ramen instant noodles in south koreabr br the package design is getting better the endorsement by professional chefs a  chefs best award is easier to read and three colored boxes in the lower right corner note that the noodles have no msg added theres  less sodium than their regular product and that the noodles have  grams of trans fatbr br i recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your instant noodles perhaps whole kernel corn for sweetness or some tofu finely chopped green onions scallions chopped cooked beef chicken or seafood an egg is another delicious additionbr br rating five starsbr br earlier this year j kenji lopezalt executive editor at serious eats posted ramen hacks  easy ways to upgrade your instant noodles i highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you will never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodlesbr br i distilled his tips down to these four bullet pointsbr br  simple addins  miso paste chili bean sauce thai curry paste japanese curry powder fish sauce harrisa vinegar and ponzubr br  vegetation  baby spinach romaine lettuce bean sprouts thinly sliced cabbage watercress and scallions should wilt in a matter of secondsbr br  eggs  hard boiled soft boiled the eggdrop method poached eggs and fried eggsbr br  simple simmered meat  thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot chicken breast pork tenderloin or flank steak are all great candidatesbr br instant noodles available at amazon that our family eats and recommendsbr br a href shim big bowl noodle udonabr a href shim big bowl noodle kimchiabr a href shim beef and ginger bowlabr a href shim kimchi noodle bowlabr a href ippeichan yakisoba noodlesabr br in many cases you can sign up for amazons subscribe  save program for additional savings and convenience,positive,positive

"As I said in my first review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, the good in The Switch outweighs the bad. The drink is tasty, and I prefer the carbonation over a straight juice product. I feel the carbonation imparts a slightly bitter finish, but that it adds to the drinkability of what is essentially a sweet but unimposing fruit flavor. So while there is nothing particularly wrong with the drink, I can't really get enthusiastic about it and I think there are better, tastier, and more economical selections available.

"I had done quite a bit of research before I chose a dog food for my dogs and this seems to be the best for the money for what I needed. I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus.

"Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />I had this with chips and it wasn't a great combination, so I had the drink by itself and it was much, much better. The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this flavor, so I will surely look into the other flavors available, most likely the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">watermelon strawberry</a> since I'll probably get a similar taste.

"I was drinking lots of tea from the local Jewel, Tetley's British blend. So when I saw this I thought it was an opportunity to try something better. Indeed its a lot better tea, does get strong nicely and I use skim milk. It tastes much better obviously than the Tetley in a box, its full bodied, but it did not have a refreshing taste.<br />The reason I say that is I was drinking some other Assam team from a store in Cleveland(Teavana) and that was very refreshing, full bodied. Likely it wasn't organic. Obviously the price at Teavana for a few oz. was a lot more per oz. than the Banaspaty tea, so it has that going for it.<br />The Twinings are pretty good, likely they have their own tea-estate, but my guess is the tea-estates vary in flavor.<br />But, hey, remember where I came from, Tetley's bags to Assam Banaspaty.

"This is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside.  There is very little taste and very little chicken.

"When it comes to low-calorie drinks, I'll usually partake in a flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to ""make the switch"" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price.",when it comes to lowcalorie drinks ill usually partake in a flavored water or apple juice this little can however packed some big tastebr br first impressions i must admit i was disappointed in the size of the container sure its slender and can fit on shelves easier but in the end it means less juice i read about the promise of  juice and  added sugars and preservatives i knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the canbr br appearance and nutrition  this can is identical to the size of a red bull giving us about  ounces to drink roughly  less than a standard soda canbr the nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs  calories theres sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of  grams  plus  grams of sugar thats regular not added it does have  vitamin c so theres a plusbr br taste this is a sweet fruity drink the sweetness is natural not artificial which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb it has the right blend of kiwi raspberry strawberry apple and grape juices  no one overpowers the other if a drink has a high carbonation level i usually hiccup but that didnt happen herebr br final thoughts while the taste is good im not ready to make the switch for two main reasonsbr  the small can sizebr  the large calorie countbr br for a quick burst of fruity goodness this is a good choice however if you want more drink with fewer calories id suggest a liter bottle of clear splash water which retails for about the same price,neutral,positive

"I don't eat gluten-free, and everyone who knows me raves about my baked goods; in fact, I have a small, custom order baking business.  I first tried this brownie mix when I was planning my Christmas gift baking last year and a cousin announced she had to eat gluten free. I was hesitant to invest in a lot of expensive ingredients I might or might not use again, so I purchased a box of this brownie mix, then tried to think of ways of how to doctor it up and make it into something that I hoped would be special.<br /><br />I came up with an idea, shipped the brownies off to her, and waited to hear if they were any good.  (I warned her that it was my first experiment in gluten free baking.)  Well, let me tell you...that grown woman went through the entire batch of brownies in under two days - they were a hit!<br /><br />I tried another recipe this week for her birthday, which is today, and the results are just in:  in her words, ""You hit it out of the park with these!""  Happily, my reputation as a fabulous baker now extends into the gluten-free realm...with a little help from Arrowhead Mills!<br /><br />Here are two ideas to get you started:<br /><br />#1 - Get a box of this brownie mix, and also a box of the Arrowhead Mills chocolate chip cookie mix.  Prepare each mix according to the directions on the boxes.  Place little mounds of the cookie dough randomly in a 9 X 13 pan, then spoon the brownie mixture around the mounds to fill in the empty spaces.  Bake.<br /><br />#2 - Prepare brownie mix according to directions and pour into a 9 X 13 pan.  In a separate bowl, mix 8 oz. of cream cheese, one egg, and a tsp. of vanilla.  Drop dollops of the cream cheese batter onto the brownie mix; run a knife or spatula through to give a swirled, marble effect.

"I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.

"What is ""four ears up""?  Read on, I'll explain later.<br /><br />The first thing I did when I received the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don't even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don't know, but for the purposes of this review, that's neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1"" x 2"" in size.  Each is scored so they can be broken in half.  I preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.<br /><br />My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman/border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman's treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular brand of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman's and one of their regular brand.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular brand first before eating the Newman's.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular brand first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman's treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman's a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he's usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usual.<br /><br />Now we get to the ""four ears up"".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman's, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an ""8 ears up"" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman's but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a ""four ears up"" rating, pretty much middle of the road.<br /><br />If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it's highly unlikely that I'll be giving them the Newman's in the future.",what is four ears up  read on ill explain laterbr br the first thing i did when i received the newmans own organics lamb and barley treats was to read the lable  darn near everything is listed as organic  whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally i dont even look for organic food for myself  is organic food actually healthier  i dont know but for the purposes of this review thats neither here nor there  the treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about  x  in size  each is scored so they can be broken in half  i preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the sizebr br my house seems to revolve around my  rescued dogs  australian kelpie mixes a yellow lab mix and a beautiful heinz  maybe a dobermanborder collie mix  weights run from  lbs to  lbs  at one point in their lives all of them had been abused and i do know for a fact that  had been starved  as a result none are too picky about dog food or treats  when presented with the newmans treats for the first time  dogs took them quickly but not as quickly as usual  one dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it  my lab spent about  seconds sniffing before she would take it  when given their regular brand of treats the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them  at another treat time each dog was presented with  treats side by side on the floor one of the newmans and one of their regular brand  two dogs including the hesitant lab chose their regular brand first before eating the newmans  the nd time i tried that  out of four at their regular brand first  that pretty much ended the experimentation and i just gave the newmans treats until they were gone one of the kelpies actually refused the newmans a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since hes usually the first in line at treat time the others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them  when we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usualbr br now we get to the four ears up  when my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up  at the treat times when they were being fed the newmans they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent  since there are four dogs with  ears each an  ears up would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something  since with the  exceptions they never did refuse the newmans but ate them without much excitement these treats get a four ears up rating pretty much middle of the roadbr br if feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you definately give thee a try  just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands  given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs its highly unlikely that ill be giving them the newmans in the future,neutral,positive

"My son has been gluten free for at least 10 years and the products that are available to a gluten-free diet have grown tremendously.  There was nothing much available 10 years ago.  The crackers and bread usually crumbled if you just looked at them!  They were mainly made out of rice flour and rice flour is not good for main ingredient in making breads, cookies and cakes. Good crackers, or just finding crackers that were gluten free was not an option back then either.  These crackers rock!  They are so much like the real thing that I prefer them over the wheat crackers; saltine or keebler club crackers.  I think this cracker is right in the middle of the two as far as taste-like. The crackers have a real good crunch factor!  The only down side to my order was that the crackers in each bag did seem to have more broken then whole.  I was not happy about that.

"I have to tell you all this one is the best I've tasted. Seen this at Costco one day a month ago. I only had purchased one 4.5 lb bag. I had like it so much I had gone back for more. Although cheaper than Amazon, I still buy it off Amazon. Since Costco doesn't carry them again. I just placed in another order and he had arrived quick!. When I first did a order the Oats was shipped Next Air via Las Vegas. That's real good service from Amazon. As for this product you can't compare it with anything you buy at Whole Foods nor regular Oatmeal.<br /><br />I've prepare this produce on the store and in two different type of Steamers. I don't use water method. I only use Silk or Blue Diamond Almond Milk Original on both. I use also Honey from local Farm which I wish Amazon would carry. You really don't have to use Honey but I like it so I use it. I set this to cook for 15 minutes in a Steam Oven I got from Amazon. I also have BPA Steamer I also got from Amazon. That one 11L  I can place 3x glass bowls (pyrex type) In the steamer with water only 3x can be cooked in 20 minutes. In Oven Steamer it's about 15 minutes with the Conventional Fan going. On the store using Ceramic cookware cooks pretty fast though. I like the steamer better because you get the puff of hot steam and the oats taste just right.<br /><br />I have bowl of this Oats every morning and look forward to the next day to have it!

"How nice it is to no longer be deprived of pasta and noodles. If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one.

This is quite a good green tea.  Other than buying generic green teabags, I usually buy a Bancha tea. This tea is not as grassy, more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it.<br /><br />The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh.

"Earl Grey Tea can be overwhelming. Generally, when an Earl Grey calls itself ""Bold"", they aren't joking. Personally, if there is too much bergamot oil in the tea, it is too overpowering for me to drink. I like to drink an aromatic tea, not a cup of perfume. The Rishi Earl Grey tea is described as ""bold and sweetly smooth with an enlivening aroma of bergamot citrus."" I think that sums it up very well. I was a little concerned when I popped the lid on the tin, as the scent was very powerful.  However, it is a pleasant smelling tea that does not overwhelm me when the cup reaches the mouth. I can taste a high quality, rich black tea with sweet and lightly citrus tones.<br /><br />I also feel good about drinking this tea because it is a Fair Trade Certified tea that is shade grown from heirloom tea trees. It's organic as well as Kosher. Rishi also says this tea can be steeped multiple times, so this tea is also very economical. I'll definitely be trying more Rishi teas.",earl grey tea can be overwhelming generally when an earl grey calls itself bold they arent joking personally if there is too much bergamot oil in the tea it is too overpowering for me to drink i like to drink an aromatic tea not a cup of perfume the rishi earl grey tea is described as bold and sweetly smooth with an enlivening aroma of bergamot citrus i think that sums it up very well i was a little concerned when i popped the lid on the tin as the scent was very powerful  however it is a pleasant smelling tea that does not overwhelm me when the cup reaches the mouth i can taste a high quality rich black tea with sweet and lightly citrus tonesbr br i also feel good about drinking this tea because it is a fair trade certified tea that is shade grown from heirloom tea trees its organic as well as kosher rishi also says this tea can be steeped multiple times so this tea is also very economical ill definitely be trying more rishi teas,positive,positive
"Switch Orange/Tangerine is billed as the natural alternative to sodas and/or artificially-sweetened juice drinks.  However, I found it to be pretty ordinary.<br /><br />First the good stuff: It is 100% Orange & Tangerine juice, has no sweetners, is 100% natural, has 100% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, and has a nice carbonation tang to it.  If you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w/o actually drinking a soda, this would probably be right down your alley.<br /><br />However, I found the taste to be somewhat... odd.  I could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange, but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this Switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is ALMOST too ripe.  You know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat NOW because by tomorrow you'll need to put out for the birds?  Not exactly something that I'd look forward to drinking.<br /><br />So for me, although this was somewhat good, its not exactly something I would get again.

"This tea certainly exceeded my expectations!  While pricey, you most certainly get what you pay for.  The tea is an amazing blend of nuanced flavors.

"I've been drinking Nutiva's Hempshakes nearly every weekday for more than two years now, and it's an excellent product, but not everyone is going to like the stuff.  If you're used to traditional whey-based protein powders and want something similar, you may not like this.  It's a bit of an acquired taste and has a different mouth feel.  I don't like whey or soy powders, and wanted something with a lot of fiber that wouldn't aggravate my acid reflux.  The hempshakes fit the bill for me.  I can drink them mixed in soy or rice milk, but usually I make a quick smoothie in the morning to drink in the car while I'm taking my son to school.  This fills up for a few hours but doesn't make me feel stuffed.  I blend together 1/2 cup juice (usually Odwalla Blueberry B Monster), 1 cup soy or rice milk, a banana, and 4 tablespoons of hempshake powder.  If I need it to last me until lunchtime I'll add in a cup of frozen berries.  It's a healthy way for me to start the day, and I don't end up skipping breakfast anymore.<br /><br />I haven't noticed a big difference between the old formulation and the new, except that the new seems a little smoother so I'd guess it's probably not as gritty if you're drinking it straight rather than in a smoothie.<br /><br />Long story short:  good product, but if the word ""hemp"" makes you cringe or laugh, this probably isn't something you're going to like.",ive been drinking nutivas hempshakes nearly every weekday for more than two years now and its an excellent product but not everyone is going to like the stuff  if youre used to traditional wheybased protein powders and want something similar you may not like this  its a bit of an acquired taste and has a different mouth feel  i dont like whey or soy powders and wanted something with a lot of fiber that wouldnt aggravate my acid reflux  the hempshakes fit the bill for me  i can drink them mixed in soy or rice milk but usually i make a quick smoothie in the morning to drink in the car while im taking my son to school  this fills up for a few hours but doesnt make me feel stuffed  i blend together  cup juice usually odwalla blueberry b monster  cup soy or rice milk a banana and  tablespoons of hempshake powder  if i need it to last me until lunchtime ill add in a cup of frozen berries  its a healthy way for me to start the day and i dont end up skipping breakfast anymorebr br i havent noticed a big difference between the old formulation and the new except that the new seems a little smoother so id guess its probably not as gritty if youre drinking it straight rather than in a smoothiebr br long story short  good product but if the word hemp makes you cringe or laugh this probably isnt something youre going to like,positive,neutral

When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink...

"Lipton loose leaf tea beats any other tea I've tried, hands down. When the local groceries stopped stocking Lipton's Loose Leaf Tea. I assumed Lipton had stopped selling it because tea bags were more profitable, and people found it easier to use tea bags. WRONG, we've been sold on the idea of convenience, and taste took the back seat. This tea is packaged in a foil lined package, is fresher tasting and very consistant in quailty. Make it sweet or unsweet, it does not matter. If you make it too strong, just add water, the flavor is there!  You will be amazed as to how many GALLONS of tea you can make with one box.  You will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula. It's worth the time!  I live in an area that has very soft water, so I don't need as much product to brew a gallon. It definitely takes more if you have hard water.<br />This is how I brew mine (this may help you get started). Using a Mr. Coffee,(12 cup) Measure 3 Tablespoons (slightly rounded) and place in the filter (just as you would coffee) Fill you crafte to the max, and brew. For sweet tea, I use One and 1/4 cup sugar per gallon. It's  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher, then add the hot liquid. The sugar will dissolve completely, and you won't need as much sugar. When the sugar has dissolved, add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon. If you are not pleased with the outcome try making some adjustments. Once you figure it out. It becomes routine, and is probably one of the the most economial drinks you can make!<br />ENJOY!!<br /><br />PS I keep mine in the freezer in a ziplock, after I've opened the box.",lipton loose leaf tea beats any other tea ive tried hands down when the local groceries stopped stocking liptons loose leaf tea i assumed lipton had stopped selling it because tea bags were more profitable and people found it easier to use tea bags wrong weve been sold on the idea of convenience and taste took the back seat this tea is packaged in a foil lined package is fresher tasting and very consistant in quailty make it sweet or unsweet it does not matter if you make it too strong just add water the flavor is there  you will be amazed as to how many gallons of tea you can make with one box  you will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula its worth the time  i live in an area that has very soft water so i dont need as much product to brew a gallon it definitely takes more if you have hard waterbr this is how i brew mine this may help you get started using a mr coffee cup measure  tablespoons slightly rounded and place in the filter just as you would coffee fill you crafte to the max and brew for sweet tea i use one and  cup sugar per gallon its  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher then add the hot liquid the sugar will dissolve completely and you wont need as much sugar when the sugar has dissolved add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon if you are not pleased with the outcome try making some adjustments once you figure it out it becomes routine and is probably one of the the most economial drinks you can makebr enjoybr br ps i keep mine in the freezer in a ziplock after ive opened the box,positive,positive

"I'll keep it brief.  First, I usually don't like whole grain, multi-grain, or whole wheat pancake mixes.

Christmas morning when the cakes were on the griddle the whole downstairs was filled with the gentle aroma of butter milk and honey.  The texture is a little more than a regular pancake but in  a good way.  And the flavor.........oh my they're good.  Little butter, little Highland Sugarworks maple syrup and I was in heaven. The only negative I would point out is that if you use even parts mix and water it makes the batter a wee bit too thin for me.

"I've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesn't cost a fortune.

Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain ""Menadione Sodium Bisulfite"" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus.",ive been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesnt cost a fortune after a lot of research at various sites petguard was one on my list to try so i ordered a case from amazon and couldnt be happier  of my cats love it the rd cat is a dry food addict and im in the process of trying to convert her but its slow going be warned though this stuff smells terrible opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel but thats how cats like itbr br bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality it has low carbs low ashmagnesium high protein real human grade meat with no byproducts the vitaminsminerals are chelated for better absorption and petguard has stated they do not use bpa lined cans also contrary to what the ingredient list here on amazon says it does not contain menadione sodium bisulfite or at least the case i ordered doesnt have any listed so they must have stopped using it which is a big plus,positive,negative

"This pub mix is really a cut above your average snack to be sure.  I tend to pick up a tub of it at the local Walmart here anytime I venture there.  The flavor of it is really hard to pin down.  It's sorta a salty, garlic/onion/whatever type of blend that truly works deliciously.  I'm a self confessed snack-a-holic that has tried just about everything around, and personally I have not tasted anything that is quite like this blend.  It's really good with your favorite beer, or just by itself and I highly recommend it.  The only down side to this stuff is the price.  Which is not something usually cared about or taken into account with UTZ products, which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part.  Unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good, this mix is not easily found locally.  I see it only at the local Walmart here in the small 20 oz size that carries a hefty price.  I buy it anyway on occasion for its so good, but make no mistake about it, its not cheap as snack chips go.  And unfortunately I do not recommend buying this mix on Amazon in any size.  It's way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered.

"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try.

"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.<br /><br />The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb.",for a microwavable chili this stuff and the firehouse variant do taste good however i never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave ive followed the directions exactly on the label as well as tried some tweaking and nothing so far has prevented it from explodingbr br the problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on it is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering irony is there is not enough venting the chili plugs the holes and as it boils and water vapor expands it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwavebr br i wish i could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess so far the firehouse variant hasnt exploded on me but it also has less meat and beans to it since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy i may just stick with that until campbells can make this not a bomb,negative,positive

"I've probably tried about 15 varieties of beans from Rancho Gordo.  They're all excellent.  Some are better suited for one type dish than another, and if you visit their website, they will tell you what works best for which dish.<br /><br />Some are just plain gorgeous to boot!  And being heirloom, I believe you can also save some back to plant, if you have the climate for growing them.  (Unfortunately, I don't.)<br /><br />Out of all the ones I've tried, we like the Borlotti best - they cook up plump and will hold their shape, with a creamy interior.  They're fantastic for Mexican-style beans - frijoles borrachos, refried, whatever you like.  And I've also cooked them with ham hocks/garlic/onions etc. for a delightful bowl of beans.<br /><br />This particular assortment doesn't have the Borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order!  It's a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their products.<br /><br />Oh yeah, sign up for their newsletter too, Steve sends out a good one with recipes and stories of the beans.",ive probably tried about  varieties of beans from rancho gordo  theyre all excellent  some are better suited for one type dish than another and if you visit their website they will tell you what works best for which dishbr br some are just plain gorgeous to boot  and being heirloom i believe you can also save some back to plant if you have the climate for growing them  unfortunately i dontbr br out of all the ones ive tried we like the borlotti best  they cook up plump and will hold their shape with a creamy interior  theyre fantastic for mexicanstyle beans  frijoles borrachos refried whatever you like  and ive also cooked them with ham hocksgarliconions etc for a delightful bowl of beansbr br this particular assortment doesnt have the borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order  its a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their productsbr br oh yeah sign up for their newsletter too steve sends out a good one with recipes and stories of the beans,positive,positive

I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do.

"I don't mean ""good for a gluten free cookie"", or ""almost like a normal cookie"".  No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me.",i dont mean good for a gluten free cookie or almost like a normal cookie  no i mean that as a cookie they are good  no strange textures odd flavors or smells  no sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture  they basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free  no milk or butter either so i believe they should be casein free also  according to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as wellbr br thats a mighty impressive list of good stuff  youre probably wondering what the catch is right  it definitely isnt the taste  as i said at the beginning these are very very good  i only see two drawbacksbr  cost  most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isnt unexpectedbr  quantity  the  ounce package contains  cookiesbr br  cookies really doesnt seem like that many particularly when enjoying them  however that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us  i know i have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much i am eating only to find ive eaten the entire bag  since the package is a builtin pause  stop point the smaller size less overeating  even so i still wish there were more in a packagebr br one last note just because i found it to be unusual  normally all the cookies would be packed the same way ie two rows of eight  these arent  instead there are two rows of seven cookies each side by side and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated  degrees from the others  there isnt anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space  its just not how most packaged cookies are packaged nor is it symmetrical so it sticks out as unusual to me,positive,positive

"The Switch Orange Tangerine soda is an attempt to made a fruit soda with real fruit juice, real fruit flavor, and no added sugar.  They have mostly succeeded.  In the glass, the Switch looks like juice.  It is lightly but distinctly carbonated and easy to drink.  The orange and tangerine flavors are true - none of the ""burn"" of fake orange flavor.  The hit of tangerine is really nice and I greatly enjoyed the flavor.  My problem with the Switch was that it was too sweet for my taste.  I was surprised at the how sweet it was given the advertised ""no added sugar"".  The ingredient list mentions grape and apple juice concentrates.  That's how they get the sugars in without adding sugar.  Fruit juice concentrates are loaded with natural fruit sugars.  The nutritional label tells the story:  the 8.3 oz can has 34 grams of sugar!  That's more than Cocoa Cola (27 grams per 8 oz).  Bottom line - this is just too sweet for me.  It's too bad because the flavors are awesome.

"I have a small dog who is finicky and most treats/dog food gives her diarrhea.  She loves pupperoni and will carry around a beggin strip for hours and rarely eat one.  With milk bones, she whines and tries to bury them in the sofa cushions and finally after a day or two, maybe, eat them.  All this is said so you can see just how finicky she is.  She really does not like anything hard.  These treats are thick and rectangular with a score down the middle so you can break them in to two squares.  I broke one and my dog carefully took it from my hand and then looked at me as if to say ""now what"".  She set it down, looked at me again and then picked it up again.  She didn't try to bury it like she does with milk bones but tried to eat it.  Several minutes went by as she gnawed away, making no progress.  I took it away from her and the outside was a little softer but the biscuit was still too hard.  She really wanted it back so I let her work on it a little longer.  She still hadn't managed to get any off of it so I took it away and soaked it in warm water for a couple of minutes.  This softened it just enough that she munched it down.<br /><br />The next time I offered her one of these treats, she held it in her mouth for a few minutes and the next thing I hear is crunching!!  She loves them.  She's missing a lot of teeth and is still able to crunch these down.  These treats are never hauled around the house and I have not found one in the sofa or her bed.<br /><br />I really like the ingredient list: lamb, apple (her favorite), carrots - natural stuff that I recognized and NO corn.

"This is a very tasty product. Tastes more like tuna. However I believe the 35mg of salt listed on the indgredients for a 1/4 cup serving is much lower than the actual salt content. I use very little salt and these are somewhat salty. I also opened a can of Crown Prince natural brisling sardines in water which has a salt content of about 45 mg. The crown prince tasted much less salty than the Roland sardines. So I think Roland needs to be a little more careful about their packaging and list of ingredients.

"We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end.  These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them.<br /><br />He can be a little picky.  Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Amazon, Zuke's Jerky Naturals.  I will say that we tried two different kinds.  Along with these, we tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MLKXOU"">Wellness WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch</a>.<br /><br />The Zuke's are really potent.  When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are.  They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one).  The Wellness treats seem a little dryer.  While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness.  Plus they're cheaper so that's even better.

These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill.  Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill.  That way he doesn't even know he's taking it.

"Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet.

"RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br />""Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe.

Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!!

"Coriander is my favorite spice after cumin and I go through loads of it. I put it in practically everything I cook. The only problem is it's so freaking expensive. If you buy it in a grocery store you need to pay 5 bucks for a dinky little container! So I shopped around a bit online until I found this and it's the best deal I could come up with.<br /><br />I mean, two whole pounds of coriander for under 12 bucks!? It sounds too good to be true. However, the price was too low to resist and I figured that even if it was poor quality, I could just use a double or triple amount, because TWO POUNDS.<br /><br />Anyways, the coriander itself comes in two 1-pound metallic bags. So far I've only opened one and the other is chilling in my freezer. The coriander is fragrant and flavorful, even better than I expected. The only danger is that I might overspice as I eagerly throw handfuls of the stuff into everything I make. Why? Because I have TWO POUNDS! If I ever run out I will definitely consider buying this again.<br /><br />The only real con is that there is so much coriander that it might take too long to use and lose flavor over time. I honestly don't think that will be a problem for me considering how much I use, but it might be smart to split the order among multiple people.

"There is known design flaw having to do with the gasket on the upper needle. You can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'My Cup'. The gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly. Green Mountain seems to not want to fix it since it means selling less over-priced coffee, which is what these machines are designed to do.<br /><br />1. No matter what method I use, I have learned to carefully reach in and pull the little washer/gasket down as far as I can on the upper needle. This will ensure a better seal and avoid overflow.<br /><br />2. Just as importantly when I put the DisposaKup in, I press it down to make sure the lower needle has pierced the cup completely.

"I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.

"My friend and I had a flavor tripping party for two.  We each dissolved one tablet on our tongues and then dug in to a plate full of lemons, limes and other sour items.  The effect was immediate and amazing.  We were laughing hysterically throughout the whole ordeal.

"My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far ""over-medicating"" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).<br /><br />I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced. All in all, we're both really happy with these.

"The Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are really yummy!

Pretty cool.<br /><br />The bananas I didn't like that much -- others may like them.

"I gave this flavor to my 6 month old son but he did not like it so I tried to blend it, but still no luck. It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br /><br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it.",i gave this flavor to my  month old son but he did not like it so i tried to blend it but still no luck it does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends so i mixed the blended beef stew with green beans   oz of beef stew with oz green beans  and my baby ate it all no problem i just think since he did not have any flavor like that before  tomato beef spices  he just need to get used to the flavor sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste i will keep adding less of the veggie blends and i bet he will get used to the taste in no time so do not give up if your baby doesnt like it right away i bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them  sushi oysters  so let your little one get used to new flavorbr my son loved chick chick and super salmon right away but i think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor alreadybr br update one week later i have split the packet in two containers and added oz sweet peas and oz carrots and my baby ate it no problem likes it a lot when warmed upbr week after that i just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem loved it as much as chick chick or super salmonbr so if you did not have luck first time do not give up it took couple tries for us and now he loves it,positive,positive

"Taste wise, these treats have ""paw's up"" from our 5 dogs. We have a yellow lab who absolutely loved them, a few bites and it was gone. She had no problems chomping it up. Our maltese took her time and ate every last crumb she could find. Our shih tzu did the same. Their offspring had no problems as well. Our maltese is a mere 9lbs and I did not need to break them in half. I do like the fact they have the line down the center for easy breaking in two. Our eldest is quite picky, she is 17 and has years of experience with treats. Dispite being picky and not having many teeth left, she did take half of one that was offered and ate it. Mind you- she is a slow eater and can still chew hard treats and food. So 5 out of 5 taste wise.<br /><br />Parent wise, as their owners we want them to eat healthy food with the right ingredients and these fit that criteria. They are not only tasty but healthy. Because they are a dry treat they leave crumbs.

If it were not for local leash laws, we would not own a leash. The only problem I see with this product is the inconsistent size of the peices.

"This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever.

It's garbage.",this review will make me sound really stupid but whatever i dont really care as long as people find out whats real and can avoid my mistakesbr br i got my wonderful little sweet bella bean when she was a few days shy of three years old she had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap i have had cats around me my entire life for about twentyfive years now my mother always just fed them whatever the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket  friskies nine lives kit  kaboodle stuff like that and our cats were always fine at least in terms of their eating habits they would eat in the morning stop when they were done come back and eat some more when they got hungrybr br my housemate at the time was working for hills and assured me that this was the best food ever made so great so on and so forth i now know that she is an utter buffoon but i initially trusted her judgment which is so unfortunate because she doesnt think she also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags which made it a much more attractive choicebr br i first tried feeding the little bean an unmeasured amount of science diet in a bowl but that didnt work as she would devour it in one sitting so then i took to measuring it and she did the same thing then i started parsing it out to twice a day that didnt work either because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day running around intentionally destroying things deliberately spilling her water crying etc until she got more food so then i split it into three servings same thing then it got to be four servings that was a little better but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times so then it went back to three all the while i was trying to reduce the amount of food i was feeding her to less than  of a cup because she was a little chubby reducing was hell she became even more hungry but i figured she would get used to it not reallybr br for over a year she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way knocking things off my desk ripping up any paper she could find scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief as soon as she got food she was back to her sweet self but only for three or four hoursbr br we thought she was bored we thought she was a little nutty and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder she always wanted food it was kind of funny but in the end it was just sadbr br a few weeks back we took her to a new good nonmoney factory vet for her second checkup since ive had her i talked with him about her being always hungry he asked what she ate and i told him the adult indoor science diet without saying as much he basically told me that this food is garbage and i should look for something else he said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients science diet does in a very loose byproduct kind of way  ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it healthy instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning not that i care about spending money on the bean but this food is way too expensive for what it isbr br so we began transitioning her onto wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago she is still eating  percent science diet with  percent wellness you really shouldnt just give a cat different food one day out of the blue but she never freaks out anymore its amazing and its  percent because she is eating real food now along with that sawdust and chicken hearts i still regrettable have to feed her we have her down to eating twice a day only  cup in total she was eating three times a day  of a cup in total now she eats some in the morning walks away eats some more a few hours later and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding no more knocking things over no more trashing dads papers on the desk no more howling no more deliberately spilled water on the floor its incrediblebr br i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever but no she was genuinely hungry because she wasnt eating any real foodbr br do your cat a favor  buy her or him so food made with real ingredients things you would eat  wellness halo innova evo whatever figure it out for yourself but please dont feed your cat this its garbage,negative,positive

"When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.",when my vet told me my little yorkie had stage iv luxating patellas knees blown out i was devastated the vet told me to give her glucosamine  chondrotin i went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the chicken flavor tablets for such a large chain tablets were the only product they carried they are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small lbs dog  on top of that she wouldnt have anything to do with them took her little nose and pushed them away i had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food it was such an annoyance i began a search for a different product form and found zukes online  they are soft she cant wait for her zukes treat every day no more crushing i still have the tabs left and will now only use zukes the product also includes beef fruits vegetables and more i am so happy with this product i will continue to use it my little echo has perked up jumps runs and one would never know she has this condition  this condition at this stage is correctable only by surgery thousands of dollars which i dont have i thank the founder of this company patrick in memory of his dog zuke they also donate to the dog  cat cancer fund i know this is a long review but thats just because this product really deserves kudosbr br as a side note my pain management physician also recommended golden aloe daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis so she both and is doing well shes my best friend im on disability and wont be able to afford the surgery if and when its required so i am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only  years old,positive,positive

"Note:  I tried the watermelon-kiwi flavor first, and this review provides comparison to that flavor as well as unique information.<br /><br />Design/packaging:  I really like the can size.  It's narrower than a soda can, but the same height as a soda can.  It fits very nicely in my hand, and I could easily toss one of these in my purse or daypack.<br /><br />Nutrition:  The calorie and sugar count seems high on this drink, but if you compare it to the nutrition of the same amount of pure, unsweetened grape juice, it's the same calorie and sugar count, plus or minus 10%.  (It's worth noting that grape juice is the first listed ingredient, so this makes sense.)  Thus, they're probably not adding sugar or calories to the juice to make the drink.  The thing is, you probably shouldn't down ten of these a day, but one can as a snack or pick-me-up seems reasonable.<br /><br />Flavor:  Here's where Switch fell short in the Watermelon-Kiwi flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this flavor was refreshing and delicious.  It was not overly sweet like Watermelon-Kiwi.  I'm also very impressed with the flavor.  It's like a less-sweet orange soda, except that it's with real juice instead of artificial sweeteners.

I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad!

"Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.",raw cacao powder differs greatly in taste than processed cacao powder commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor commercial cacao powder is mono tonal in flavor raw cacao is everything that commercial cacao isnt it is a antioxidant superfood which has no equal the taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next as to taste it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of mahogany in foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao in baking i believe it goes well with other flavors such as almond extract if you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of almond extract your icing will have no equal in chocolate cake i personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake the acid helps to unify and amplify flavors i like making cake with  cake flour which is about has about  wheat gluten and  rice flour the reason for this should be obvious the heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enoughbr br raw cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and procyanidins and has been shown to inhibit lowdensity lipoprotein ldl oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma highdensity lipoprotein hdl and decreases ldl levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens,positive,positive

Fruits listed are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola (whatever that is).<br /><br />Intriguingly, the can mentions ""contains soy"" at the end of the ingredients list.

"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are incredible. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia seeds, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of Chia seeds, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite. I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days. One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles. But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon! Could the chia seeds have helped? I think so. I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds, but have since started buying it on Amazon for a fraction of the price.

"I'm an American which means I don't know squat about good olive oils.  Well, that used to be true.  Now I know a little something about them that I'd like to share with you.  I was a typical person... I bought olive oil at my local grocery store but I didn't really know anything about it.  In time I learned about cold-pressed olive oil being preferred.  Next i learned a little more about the deeper concepts of olive oil.  I sampled various relatively expensive domestic brands, the kinds available at my local Harris Teeter.  But my experiences weren't very fruitful.  I simply wasn't moved.  Until I decided to give in to a wild hare and order a foreign bottle of olive oil.  And WOW!  What a difference!! Such a fruitful nose and a beautiful color.  I never knew it could be like this.  I simply didn't have a clue that this could exist.  But what I ordered was fairly expensive.  At least compared to what I could get locally.  THIS PARTICULAR olive oil was my second foree into non-domestic samples.  And not only is it better than the first REAL olive oil I tried, it's cheaper.  If you choose this olive oil you're going to pay about 30% more than what you can get locally.  With shipping costs and all.  (Minus sales tax, yay!)  But this olive oil is very high quality.

"I first tasted yuban while visiting my brother 20 years ago. he offered me a cup of coffee one morning, and I really liked it. It had a taste that was way different than I was used to.

I have since switched back to regular yuban, but my wife still uses decaf. we were drinking maxwell house at the time. Found out later that yuban is part of maxwell house. Yuban costs about a penny a pot more that I am more than ready to pay for the better taste. maxwell house is great coffee, and my 2nd choice. we carry our own coffee and coffee makers with us when we travle.

"I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.

"This tea is strong and has a smoky flavor - you can feel the leafy greenness though. It's not very bitter. I think it's a bit expensive for it is - but I haven't found a replacement.

"What do fruit, brownies, and meat have in common? Yep the answer is they all go amazingly well with this chile lime seasoning. Sprinkling this stuff on top of wip cream is also a surprizing treat. Its great in a brownie batter, and is a wonderfull marinade for grillables. Its also perfect if you need to add a tart zing to a dish without adding any liquid. Toss french fries, chips, or any other fried foods immediately in this seasoning, after it comes out of the oil. It adds the acid that fried foods so desperately need, while still keeping them crispy. Who wants to mush up the batter with lime juice, well I use to, but not anymore?<br /><br />This seasoning will make you explore the boundaries of savory and sweet combinations (since it labeled itself a fruit seasoning), some will be delightful and others will be horrible failures. However, the experiences you will gain and the palette lessons you will learn from this magical seasoning are priceless.I liked the 8 pack because I saved on shipping with the amazon prime discount and also got to hand out 6 of them as gifts/party favors.",what do fruit brownies and meat have in common yep the answer is they all go amazingly well with this chile lime seasoning sprinkling this stuff on top of wip cream is also a surprizing treat its great in a brownie batter and is a wonderfull marinade for grillables its also perfect if you need to add a tart zing to a dish without adding any liquid toss french fries chips or any other fried foods immediately in this seasoning after it comes out of the oil it adds the acid that fried foods so desperately need while still keeping them crispy who wants to mush up the batter with lime juice well i use to but not anymorebr br this seasoning will make you explore the boundaries of savory and sweet combinations since it labeled itself a fruit seasoning some will be delightful and others will be horrible failures however the experiences you will gain and the palette lessons you will learn from this magical seasoning are pricelessi liked the  pack because i saved on shipping with the amazon prime discount and also got to hand out  of them as giftsparty favors,positive,positive

"Saw this at a local big-box chain store, so of course I had to look for it on Amazon as soon as I got home. Received the item in 2 days (Prime really rocks, doesn't it?) and am so happy; we can finally get rid of our K-cup carousel.<br /><br />This drawer holds more K-cups and keeps them out of sight, freeing countertop real estate. It glides open smoothly and seems very well made. It was shipped in a nice sturdy box and arrived in excellent condition. The drawer has 6 divided sections, each of which holds 6 K-cups. Perfect for us, since we like variety! The drawer doesn't pull completely out, but has a built-in stop; it doesn't seem to make it harder to get the last K-cup out, at least for me. I'm a female with average lady-fingers. YMMV. Still, I like the stop, I wouldn't want to have K-cups rolling all over the kitchen floor.<br /><br />Note - if you keep your machine under upper cabinets, you'll likely need to pull it out away from the wall to allow enough clearance to insert K-cups and fill the reservoir. We just turned our unused kitchen desktop (it's counter is 3-4"" lower) into a coffee station.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't carry the T-disc version of this drawer, so tomorrow it's back to the store to buy one of those.

"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!",buyer beware please this sweetener is not for everybody  maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body  you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience nausea diarrhea  headaches can also be experienced i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell  i thought id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in  the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before  i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping  as the symptoms passed this too was very unpleasant  though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market  the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters thank goodness id eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others like me can have a bad reaction to it in case youre like me  its not you its the maltitol,negative,negative

"I ordered these simply out of curiosity. All those rumors about space food people have been spreading around. First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods.

I have a serious green tea addiction and I'm always looking to explore different flavour profiles and various additions to the wonder that is green tea; this didn't disappoint. The brown rice comes through with it's nutty flavour but doesn't overpower the green tea.

"I've been eating Nong Shim's noodles for years -- I particularly like eating their Spicy Seafood udon-style noodles (not 'instant' stuff like this).  Their products usually deliver on lots of flavor and a decent textured noodles.  This Spicy Chicken flavor bowl of noodle soup would be the first instant variety of their noodles I've tried.<br /><br />The quality/texture of the noodles is similar to that of the Nissin brand noodles (better than Maruchan).  What sets this apart is the soup base flavor pack which delivers a more complex flavor and IMO tastes much better by comparison.  Since they give you the soup base pack, it gives you the option to add as much or as little flavoring as you'd like (whereas Cup O' Noodles, you're usually stuck with however much they give you).  It has the usual dehydrated veggies.  Other reviewers mention that there are little chunks of chicken... Reading the ingredients, I don't see a single mention of chicken besides chicken broth.<br /><br />Whereas the typical Cup o' Noodle will deliver 2.25-oz of unhealthy goodness, these bowls of noodle delivers 3.03oz.  The bowl of noodles wasn't that filling -- it'd be a perfect sized snack.  I don't know how they would conclude that this bowl would be equivalent to 2 servings.  The bowl delivers 380 calories (120 from fat), 14g of fat, 6g of saturated fat, 1780 mg of sodium, 56g of carbs, 2g of dietary fiber, and upwards of 2g of sugar, and 8g of protein.<br /><br />On the packaging, it seems NongShim is trying to sell you on the product being healthy.  It touts ""No MSG added,"" ""30% less sodium than our regular product,"" ""0g trans fat.""  It has received some ""2011 Chef's Best Award"" and is ""Endorsed by Professional Chefs.""

"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.

"This is a very good coffee, and I am one who loves his coffee. Why do I love this coffee? Well, I loved it so because it was strong, but not overly simplistic. It had hints of many different flavors, and they were blended together to form a symphony of taste. In fact, it was as strong as starbucks, but not pedestrian and simplistic. It also brewed very nicely in my Mr.Coffee brewer, as well as my camp percolator.

"My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earth's best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I can't figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the ""subscribe and save"" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons).

"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  ""Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle.""  ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.""  ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.

"This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that ""yogurt powder"" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the ""natural flavorings,"" etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a ""vitamin blend"" -- there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.

"I tasted this Matcha from Rishi the first time today. The flavor is bright, assertive and fresh. It mixes nicely into both hot and cold liquids, leaving no clumps of tea at the bottom of my glass after it was whisked. The tea powder is fine, giving it smoothness, no grittiness or grainy feel. I had it both in water and with milk; in both the flavor was not muddied. The flavor is more intense (bold) than most Matcha I've had, making others seem bland by comparison. Nothing off-putting, just seems more concentrated. It has a good crisp green color, and each packet holds about one tablespoon of Matcha.

When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.

"I am a huge fan of Jamaica Me Crazy coffee.  There was a time in my life when I was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff, but a customer in the bank I worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers.  Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it broke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite brew in a K-cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.

"I love this Bisquick Mix!  Over the past 10 years, since being diagnosed wheat gluten intolerant, I have tried so many gluten free mixes that were so bad I ended up feeling like I might as well be eating the box!  This Bisquick mix is by far the best I have found for making scones (plain or sweet) and biscuits!  The Orange biscuits, cheddar biscuits and raisin scones I have made were delicious. It was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes, because unlike some gluten free mixes, I found I can play around with this and don't have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome.  Of course, you can't roll this dough out like traditional dough, it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls.  I have found that if I don't make it too sticky, I can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits. I have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza (be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan - I use a silicone spatula to press it so that it doesn't stick).

"I am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way. And I have never been happy hobbling my horse - I'd rather she could escape from a dangerous situation, and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home. Sooo - here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds, thus is easy to pack for trail rides. And since it operates on easily-obtainable D cells, no problem being ""off the grid"".<br /><br />The Fi-Shock HC-100 Portable Paddock showed up in a nice durable red Cordura nylon case. The long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. Their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. Multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set-up.<br /><br />A smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. It contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel (no, I don't know why the product description says 200'), the transformer of nicely molded, durable-looking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two D cell batteries which I promptly put in a safer place so they couldn't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.<br /><br />This proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. Properly set up, the paddock's batteries did not drain. Of course I carried extras. I also chose to guy the corners which I am used to with tents. Of course I had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. No problem.<br /><br />This worked... for ONE not-huge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she doesn't challenge them. Sure, any beast of her size could easily break out, but I'd want her to if in danger. No, I can't see how the stated 4 or 5 horses could be contained in this enclosure.

After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!

"We got this in the mail and were eager to try it.  I am a huge fan of Izze Sparkling Juice and figured this would be similar to that.  It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.<br /><br />TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I don't see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.<br /><br />BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.<br /><br />VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in today's economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isn't something I can see myself buying for my large family.

"I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted. I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable.

Amazon is my lifeline for quality organic foods and other products. Incidentally, I don't make the typical lentil soup with these.

"I think I can call myself a good Turkish Tea drinker. If you are not familiar with any of these teas, choose the cheapest one, which is the Yellow box (Turist) in general. It will give you 80-90% the same taste. The pink/red box (Filiz) is supposed to be the next better one, while it is the most favorite choice for many Turkish tea lowers. The red box (Cay Cicegi) is presented as better and stronger than Filiz, and the black box (Altinbas) is best among these four tea types.

"Bisto is hands down the best! My mother turned me onto it a few years back and now I wouldn't think of using a white thickener (flour, corn starch) for any meat or poultry gravy again!<br /><br />What's so fantastic about Bisto Favourite is that you can make as much gravy as you want even from meats that give you hardly any drippings. Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor, color and body.<br /><br />I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally, I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.<br /><br />What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate, pour a little water over it. Place the meat/potatoes/whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus.

"I was in a local supermarket one day when I noticed several ladies flocking into the coffee aisle and throwing eight or nine canisters at a time of Folgers Classic Roast coffee into their shopping carts! As it turns out, the coffee was on sale; and the customers wanted to ""stock up"" on it. I asked one of these customers about Folgers and she swore that it was the best coffee out there. I then tried it myself--and wow, those people sure were right!<br /><br />Folgers Classic Roast Ground Medium coffee can be made in any coffee pot or coffee maker and the seal on the top of the canister helps to keep the ground coffee fresh. The coffee is consistently tasteful and it gives you a great, good tasting pick-me-up in the morning.<br /><br />The directions are simple enough: Use roughly one tablespoon of Folger's ground coffee to make one six fluid ounce serving of coffee. I use two tablespoons full when I want a mug full of coffee to start my day. In addition, you probably should refrigerate the canister after you open it; but I leave the canister on my kitchen countertop or even in a kitchen cabinet and the coffee still tastes great. If you can catch a sale on this terrific coffee I would suggest that you stock up. You can even put the unused canisters in your freezer for up to several months, maybe even a year. It will stay fresh and taste every bit as good after you let it defrost.<br /><br />Only one cautionary note that you probably already figured anyway--don't drink this if you are sensitive to caffeine. Consult your doctor if your stomach or your system is sensitive to anything that contains caffeine before you drink this coffee. Folgers also makes decaffeinated coffee that is quite good; I've tried it.<br /><br />Folgers also makes this coffee at what they call different ""roast levels,"" or what we would probably call ""strengths."" You can choose from mild, medium, medium-dark and dark. I usually see just medium and medium-dark on the grocer's shelf. Amazon offers the medium strength of the coffee which what I personally prefer.<br /><br />All in all, Folgers is far and away the best coffee on my grocer's shelf and it should remain extremely popular for some while to come. It costs a bit more than some other brands of coffee but it's worth every penny you'll spend on it.

"I have 4 enormous ornamental planters in my gardens, which I have planted with purchased annuals for over 20 years. I am very experienced, and these planters have excellent drainage. This year, I switched the potting soil out for Miracle Gro Moisture Control. I flooded the planters before putting the plants in - several times. I planted them, and watered every single day from necessity. This soil product felt moist, but none was shared with the plants - their soil root balls stayed bone dry. The 2 planters in full sun had dying plants. I plunged my arm at least 25 inches down into the planters and the soil was hotter than beach sand, all the way down. This product somehow retains heat and was cooking my plants. When I removed this soil, I was surprised to find big pockets of it that were dust dry. The 2 planters in shade did a little better, but no plant growth whatsoever. Maybe if the plants grew in this from seed, they would do better, but you can't put plants in root balls into it - this soil just won't let the moisture leach into adjacent soils. And it cooks them. If your plants are still alive, rescue them and replace the soil.

"This freeze dried ice cream is great! It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the ""astronaut"" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.<br /><br />Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.<br /><br />It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.<br /><br />With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream.

"The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal.

"I am a college student and wanted to get a unique plant for my dorm. In my eagerness to buy this plant, I accidentally sent this plant to my home address instead of my dorm. Despite this delay, my plant arrived about one week after I first ordered it. (Had it been shipped correctly, it would have taken only four days). In addition, the plant STILL arrived in good condition. Its growing very well.<br /><br />A few things to note: This plant is, as stated, in a 3"" pot. Don't expect a giant man-eating plant. My plant came with about seven heads and a flower stem, which will hopefully bloom soon. The one thing that this plant does not come with his any sort of terrarium or other habitat for it, though the plant's robustness makes up for it. Make sure to follow the special care instructions with it and the plant will grow fine.

"Being the lone Celiac in the crowd makes for challenging entertaining. Most of the crackers I've had/served leave a fine dust coating on the pallet, or they have an aftertaste. This cracker does NEITHER. It's a little strong on the sesame flavor, but it really is a great cracker to serve with Alouette cheese, etc.  It was a real crowd pleaser at our holiday gatherings, and several non-Celiac family members and friends now keep it on hand in their pantries just because of the taste. One of the things that I just couldn't keep plated was when I put a little garlic/onion cream cheese on one of these crackers and topped it with a tidbit of smoked salmon. ;-) The only bad thing (and the first reason I won't give it 5 stars) is that the cracker gets soggy if you plate the stuff even just 30 minutes before serving, so you really have to make it as needed, or let it be self-serve/assemble. The other reason I only give it 4 stars I'm listing as a cautionary statement...<br /><br />CAUTION: it's not certified gluten free, and to my knowledge, it's not tested.

"It's exactly what it claims to be: carbonated juice. Imagine mixing 2 parts snapple with 1 part seltzer.

I can hardly taste any strawberry. It tasted more like grape and maybe a hint raspberry.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent alternative to soda. It's a bit on the pricey side at nearly a dollar for a 8.3 oz can. The only non-natural ingredient is ascorbic acid AKA Vitamin C as a preservative. In fact, I would recommend they add a little more Vitamin C to give it more tart. As is, it contains 100% DV of Vitamin C.<br /><br />I'd say its worth buying.

They said she might have cancer on her leg and probably need to cut off her leg.<br />I didn't have the money to take her back to the vet to check up again when is was crying in pain. So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again. My dog doesn't like the taste but I sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem. Thank you so much Zuke's. From now on I will buy every month for her.,i have a maltese and she is  yrs she was limping and i took her to the vet they said she might have cancer on her leg and probably need to cut off her legbr i didnt have the money to take her back to the vet to check up again when is was crying in pain so then i read others reviews on amazon and found zukes i immediately bought it and gave her  doses a day for a week and now she is running around the house ans jumps again my dog doesnt like the taste but i sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem thank you so much zukes from now on i will buy every month for her,positive,positive

"Initially I purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores. Here's my initial report and impressions:<br /><br />The tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible. The bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport. So a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good. I would hope that in the future Lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you don't have tea leaves all over the place.<br /><br />And as another reviewer mentioned, it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands. And as always, you pay for what you get. I didn't expect this to be better than my Jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about $45 and taste fantastic. My goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which I was able to do well with that.<br /><br />Here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing:<br /><br />-1 Gallon of Lemon Iced Tea-<br /><br />1. 1 Gallon of water<br />2. 5-9 Tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea<br />3. Empty teabags<br />4. 1 cup of sugar<br />5. 1/2 cup of lemon juice<br /><br />Lipton's direction call for 2 tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea to make 1 1/2 quarts of black tea to drink. We know that 4 quarts is equal to 1 gallon, if we used 4 tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with 3 quarts of tea which is short of one gallon. If 2 tablespoons makes 1 1/2 quarts then 1 tablespoon would make about .75 of a quart. So you would need at least a minimum of 5 tablespoons or even about 5 1/4 tablespoons of tea leaves to get your 4 gallons. I would not recommend using more than 9 tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong. Some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but I would have to disagree with that. I thought the tea wasn't strong enough.<br /><br />So go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point. Use between 5-9 tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags. The directions call for brewing your tea for about 3-5 minutes. Being a tea drinker I knew that if I brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter (yes! tannins are what make your tea bitter). If your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter. Initially I only brewed my tea for about 2 minutes because I was scared that the tea would be bitter if I brewed it too long. But I found that 2 minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. That is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so Lipton's brewing time was about spot on. After you finish brewing your tea add your 1 cup of sugar and then your lemon juice. I used cane sugar and Hy-Top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want. I did try Real Lemon Juice while at another supermarket but I didn't like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by Hy-Top.<br /><br />You probably wanted to know if I actually drank the tea without it being Lemon Iced Tea, and I did. I didn't like it nor would I recommend you drink this tea this way. I just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other brands but I just feel that this tea wasn't up to par against other black teas nor do I recommend drinking it as just plain black tea. I particularly like the English Breakfast Black Tea by Stash better than this tea. I just felt that the quality difference was a lot but I didn't feel like buying every bag for $0.09 each every time I went to the supermarket just to brew Lemon Iced Tea. If you want to make lemon iced tea with the Stash brand you need 9 English Breakfast Black Tea bags and the same amount of sugar, lemon juice, and water. Economical wise I would get more tea buying Lipton but if taste matters I would choose another tea brand to make Lemon Iced Tea.<br /><br />I haven't tried making Raspberry Iced Tea with this yet but we'll save that for another adventure.",initially i purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores heres my initial report and impressionsbr br the tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible the bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport so a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good i would hope that in the future lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you dont have tea leaves all over the placebr br and as another reviewer mentioned it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands and as always you pay for what you get i didnt expect this to be better than my jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about  and taste fantastic my goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which i was able to do well with thatbr br here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testingbr br  gallon of lemon iced teabr br   gallon of waterbr   tablespoons of lipton black teabr  empty teabagsbr   cup of sugarbr   cup of lemon juicebr br liptons direction call for  tablespoons of lipton black tea to make   quarts of black tea to drink we know that  quarts is equal to  gallon if we used  tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with  quarts of tea which is short of one gallon if  tablespoons makes   quarts then  tablespoon would make about  of a quart so you would need at least a minimum of  tablespoons or even about   tablespoons of tea leaves to get your  gallons i would not recommend using more than  tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but i would have to disagree with that i thought the tea wasnt strong enoughbr br so go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point use between  tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags the directions call for brewing your tea for about  minutes being a tea drinker i knew that if i brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter yes tannins are what make your tea bitter if your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter initially i only brewed my tea for about  minutes because i was scared that the tea would be bitter if i brewed it too long but i found that  minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about   to  minutes that is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so liptons brewing time was about spot on after you finish brewing your tea add your  cup of sugar and then your lemon juice i used cane sugar and hytop reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want i did try real lemon juice while at another supermarket but i didnt like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by hytopbr br you probably wanted to know if i actually drank the tea without it being lemon iced tea and i did i didnt like it nor would i recommend you drink this tea this way i just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands maybe ive just been spoiled by other brands but i just feel that this tea wasnt up to par against other black teas nor do i recommend drinking it as just plain black tea i particularly like the english breakfast black tea by stash better than this tea i just felt that the quality difference was a lot but i didnt feel like buying every bag for  each every time i went to the supermarket just to brew lemon iced tea if you want to make lemon iced tea with the stash brand you need  english breakfast black tea bags and the same amount of sugar lemon juice and water economical wise i would get more tea buying lipton but if taste matters i would choose another tea brand to make lemon iced teabr br i havent tried making raspberry iced tea with this yet but well save that for another adventure,neutral,positive

"These raw shelled pumpkin seed kernels actually have a slight pumpkin flavor which I assume indicates that they are fresh, unlike the store bought (H-E-B) raw kernels that were pretty bland.

"The first batch I got must have been a bad batch, because it seemed to have a ""burned coffee"" smell, and smelled a bit more like chocolate raspberry or some other flavor rather than pure chocolate. It made me wonder whether Coffee Masters uses the same equipment to make both a chocolate raspberry flavor and the dark chocolate decadence flavor, and if the flavors got mixed during the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Since then, I have ordered it several more times and have been more satisfied with it. There are times, however, when those burned flavor notes creep back in, depending on the bag. I sometimes wonder if Coffee Masters overroasts their beans.<br /><br />I originally bought this coffee instead of the chocolate coffee I used to regularly enjoy but could not find on Amazon, Brothers Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Swirl.  The Coffee Masters Dark Chocolate Decadence bean is darker, oilier, and richer than the Brothers bean.  The Brothers bean coffee is milder, more like Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I still might prefer the medium-bean Brothers Blend over this coffee, even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean, as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate.<br /><br />UPDATE: I am now actively seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices.

"Patak's sauces have many uses but I always make a basic chicken curry.  A friend from India taught this recipe to me, and now I always have a jar or two on hand.  If you want you can get one of the Indian pickles/relishes as a garnish.  This is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing.  Typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish, and serves 3-4 adults.

"I purchased this product because of its name, ""Rumford NATURALS Corn Starch"" (the word ""Naturals"" appears large and clear on the pictured product label). Also, the Amazon description said it was made from ""Non-Genetically Modified Corn"". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say ""made with"" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the ""Daily Value"" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger.

"Pretty scary reading some of these reviews. I learned about the switch to new formulas from Canidae quite a while back but stuck with it.

"I recently did a taste test with my family between two store bought pizza sauces. Pastorelli and Don Pepino. They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left.",i recently did a taste test with my family between two store bought pizza sauces pastorelli and don pepino they both sell for roughly the same price both are natural with no preservatives so the only factor being judged here is taste the don pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by  the issue with the pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the pastorelli im not sure about everyone else but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts crust sauce  cheese compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three the don pepino did just that at the end of the night all of the don pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of pastorelli slices left,negative,positive
"I've been using Pill Pockets for 4 years now. I dont know why the other person had such a problem with hers.......but sometimes a few of them come crumbled in the bag....so what. You just smoosh it around your pill and the dog gobbles it down.  Maybe your's got crushed by the post office. I dont know. All I know is that regardless of what it looks like out of the bag, you can still use it. It doesnt stick to your fingers, it doesnt require refridgeration and the dogs love then.  There is a difference in the consistancy of the dough between the beef and chicken however. The Chicken is more like play dough dough, with the Beef a little stiffer like pie dough.

"Even though the product description states that this machine has three cup sizes, it has only two, and the largest is not as large as the mug-size on the top-of-the-line Keurig models.  This model fits right in the middle of Keurig machines:  it has the reservoir that the Mini Brewer lacks and yet is not as expensive as the top of the line machines.<br /><br />Since we also have the B60 model (I bought this for my daughter to use), I can tell you that the difference between the two models is small but significant:<br /><br />1. This one only brews the smallest and the mid-size cups.  If you want the large size, you can brew a mid-size cup, lift the arm, put it back down, and brew a small size through the same pod.  (It's about the same amount of water that goes through a single pod when brewing the largest size on the B60.)<br /><br />2. The construction isn't as heavy-duty as the B60's, although it's good enough, in my opinion.<br /><br />3. It doesn't look quite as nice as the B60 because it lacks the stainless drip grate and the silver accents.<br /><br />4. It takes a little longer to heat the water.<br /><br />In general, this is just a stripped down version of the B60 which makes it more affordable.  The coffee is just as good.  Because we bought a Keurig Mini Brewer for my husband's office, I realized that the reservoir is an important feature to have because otherwise it takes a lot longer to brew a single cup.  This machine has some of the strengths found in the best of the Keurig machines but at a more moderate price.  When comparing prices, keep in mind that some models found in stores offer extras such as a coffee sample pack or filter.  This one -- at least as I bought it -- contains nothing extra.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",even though the product description states that this machine has three cup sizes it has only two and the largest is not as large as the mugsize on the topoftheline keurig models  this model fits right in the middle of keurig machines  it has the reservoir that the mini brewer lacks and yet is not as expensive as the top of the line machinesbr br since we also have the b model i bought this for my daughter to use i can tell you that the difference between the two models is small but significantbr br  this one only brews the smallest and the midsize cups  if you want the large size you can brew a midsize cup lift the arm put it back down and brew a small size through the same pod  its about the same amount of water that goes through a single pod when brewing the largest size on the bbr br  the construction isnt as heavyduty as the bs although its good enough in my opinionbr br  it doesnt look quite as nice as the b because it lacks the stainless drip grate and the silver accentsbr br  it takes a little longer to heat the waterbr br in general this is just a stripped down version of the b which makes it more affordable  the coffee is just as good  because we bought a keurig mini brewer for my husbands office i realized that the reservoir is an important feature to have because otherwise it takes a lot longer to brew a single cup  this machine has some of the strengths found in the best of the keurig machines but at a more moderate price  when comparing prices keep in mind that some models found in stores offer extras such as a coffee sample pack or filter  this one  at least as i bought it  contains nothing extrabr br  debbie lee wesselmann,positive,positive
"I love a great gyros platter, but there aren't many Greek restaurants/pizzarias where I live.  So I was excited to see this offered here!  The meat was still frozen when it arrived, and the styrofoam-lined shipping box can be reused, ice packs and all.  I bought it pre-sliced, and the slices separate easily from each other in the box so you can keep it frozen and just use a little at a time.  My only complaint is that I like thicker slices; but in terms of flavor, well, I challenge you to make it at home yourself and have it taste this good.  I have a feeling I will keep a box of this on hand from now on.  One note:  the box does not contain heating instructions.  I tried it in the broiler and over-browned it.

"I've been using another type of ant gel for a couple of years now.<br /><br />It worked OK, but it has some less than desirable qualities that are improved on by this product.<br /><br />First the Hot Shot really attracts the ants much better.  Secondly that it works much much faster.  Before I'd put the bait down and have to wait a day or two to really see the results.  NOT SO WITH THE HOT SHOT!!  Put the bait across the ant line and the ants go for it right away and in a few minutes to a half hour or so the infestation is dramatically reduced.<br /><br />This clear gel is much thicker than the Combat product.  A small line as close to the entry point as you can get is all you will need.<br /><br />The only downside to this product that I've come across is that the gel seems to set up in the tip between uses.  A couple of times I've pushed so hard to get it started, that when the tip cleared a big squirt came out all at once (made a bit of a mess and wasted some of the gel).  In the future I'm going to use a toothpick to open the tip before each use.<br /><br />Another nice advantage is that the gel is clear.  The other product is honey colored and after application would sort of dry up like pitch, an amber color.  At times hard to clean out from under a metal carpet seam or in tight corner.  This product is less noticeable.<br /><br />The tip is long enough to be able to push the product into crevices.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",ive been using another type of ant gel for a couple of years nowbr br it worked ok but it has some less than desirable qualities that are improved on by this productbr br first the hot shot really attracts the ants much better  secondly that it works much much faster  before id put the bait down and have to wait a day or two to really see the results  not so with the hot shot  put the bait across the ant line and the ants go for it right away and in a few minutes to a half hour or so the infestation is dramatically reducedbr br this clear gel is much thicker than the combat product  a small line as close to the entry point as you can get is all you will needbr br the only downside to this product that ive come across is that the gel seems to set up in the tip between uses  a couple of times ive pushed so hard to get it started that when the tip cleared a big squirt came out all at once made a bit of a mess and wasted some of the gel  in the future im going to use a toothpick to open the tip before each usebr br another nice advantage is that the gel is clear  the other product is honey colored and after application would sort of dry up like pitch an amber color  at times hard to clean out from under a metal carpet seam or in tight corner  this product is less noticeablebr br the tip is long enough to be able to push the product into crevicesbr br hope this helps,positive,positive

"Based on our experience I would give this product 1 star, but I concede that our dog's reaction may not be typical.<br /><br />We gave our dog one of these early in the evening.  He's a mid-sized dog at about 35 lbs, but he's also a strong chewer.  Based on what I could tell from the package, though, I had no reason to believe I should buy the larger size.  We were in the room and casually observed him as he chewed on it.  Our dog had the whole thing eaten within an hour.<br /><br />He seemed fine and the next morning his bathroom routine was completely normal.  However, when we got home from work, it was clear that the poor guy had been struggling not to have an accident.  When we got him outside, he had multiple explosive bowel movements.  A little further examination showed us that, despite his best efforts, his butt had been leaking during the day.  He had also given himself a hemorrhoid.

"Having bought various types of vinegars hoping to find the right one but never did until now.  My local hyper market sells various brands of balsamic but some have a heft price tag, the more aged typically the more it cost.  Honestly have bought some cheap ones but got a glorified bottle of plain vinegar or was un-naturally sweet.  Made a pot of my homemade(from scratch)pasta sauce, while it's also been really good 2 tsp of Alessi made it great.  Can't believe the taste it gives to a tomatoe based sauce, was eating by the spoonfuls before adding to the pasta.  Wanting to experiment some more, I have been wanting to make some roasted red pepper remoulade to jazz up a BLT or Roast Beef sandwhich.  This was the key ingredient even more so than the roasted red peppers.  The balsamic cut the fatty taste of the mayo(not a fan of may alone except potato/pasta salad)and added an interesting sweetness but not like sugar.  Ate couple spoons of that as well.

"I'm writing this review on behalf of my husband who is the actual Starbucks VIA decaf Italian Roast coffee drinker. Because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year. He recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant. We believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot. At a recent visit to our ""local"" Starbucks, which is 90 miles away, I discovered the VIA decaf Italian Roast and bought a three pack for him to try. He likes strong, good coffee and was impressed after his first cup. He took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee, too, when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the VIA. I've placed a pre-order for the 50 pack available through Amazon and from now on when we travel, he will be carrying a supply of decaf Italian Roast VIA with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf. It seems expensive until you look at what you would pay for a cup of mediocre coffee at any restaurant.",im writing this review on behalf of my husband who is the actual starbucks via decaf italian roast coffee drinker because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year he recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant we believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot at a recent visit to our local starbucks which is  miles away i discovered the via decaf italian roast and bought a three pack for him to try he likes strong good coffee and was impressed after his first cup he took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee too when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the via ive placed a preorder for the  pack available through amazon and from now on when we travel he will be carrying a supply of decaf italian roast via with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf it seems expensive until you look at what you would pay for a cup of mediocre coffee at any restaurant,positive,positive

"My dogs are decidedly not ""new age"" or impressed by the fact that these dog treats ""are high in protein, naturally preserved with no wheat or corn, no artificial colors of [sic] flavor enhancers, and are free of added hormones, antibiotics and chemical additives.""<br /><br />Out of the bag, these treats seem decidedly overmanufactured, dry, dusty, and uninteresting. But I left it to my Australian Shepherds to decide on their own. During the first taste test, Kirwan, who will throw his head back like an alligator and eat anything tossed his way, crunched through the first one but was not interested in a second helping of these Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. Pippin, who has a more discerning palette, moved his across the rug with his nose and subsequently abandoned it.<br /><br />This morning, I placed a treat on the floor for each dog, and Kirwan ate his without enthusiasm while Pippin again ignored his.<br /><br />Look, I love my dogs and I think Newman's Own is a fine company. But this product seems to me the result of overzealous people going to great lengths to make themselves feel good about what they are feeding their dogs. I cannot imagine the amount of farmland, energy, and resources expended to create these organic dog treats. We are really out of balance here with our priorities and perspectives.<br /><br />Perhaps some animal nutritionist blessed this recipe, the art department created the bucolic packaging, and the marketing folks carefully crafted the spin for this product, all to make us feel good about having these tucked away in our pantries, but at $4 a bag, this will be the only time this product appears in our house. Besides, my dogs, who actually like foul smelling foods and will gloriously roll in who knows what sorts of awful stuff they find, do not like these sorts of boutique fabrications.<br /><br />I really think a reality check is needed.

"As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.<br /><br />With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it.",as the initial reviewer stated the biggest issue with this product is its durability or lack thereofbr br with the nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching  you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile  i timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make the one shaped like a fist  it took him  minutes to leisurely eat and about  minutes to clean up the mess  if he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster  so almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainmentchew toy product  its possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from thembr br i was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the plastic nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks ewwbr br my dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices i cant justify it,negative,positive

At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale.

"There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those ""single shot"" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.",there are things that i recall from my childhood that i would rather not  being stung by a bee chicken pox all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before i actually learned to ride it and tang  tang was that chalky never quite dissolved in the water powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as koolaid  it wasnt koolaid by any stretch of the imagination  it was tang  ive never heard anyone ask for tang it was just what was therebr br so i get my can of switch in the mail eyeball the can its the same size and shape as an energy drink can one of those single shot type cans  fearing that it was an energy drink i checked the label says its pretty much all juice carbonation and some natural flavors including soy so i pop it open and take a swigbr br now it may be  natural juices with some natural flavoring  but i know tang when i taste it  this is carbonated tang i know it is  somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered tang and someone thought to themselves  what do we do with all of this stuff  i know mix it with carbonated water and voila now its not tang its switchbr br in all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink  but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can  i would suggest whipping up your own tang with fizzy waterbr br pros pretty much all natural  juices natural flavors and no unnatural dyes good for the adhd kidsbr br cons i personally didnt care at all for the taste a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink,neutral,positive

"I saw this at my local Food 4 Less for less than $3 (5 oz.) and had to give it a try. I've seen this hot sauce online before but could never justify paying the high cost plus shipping so I thought $3 was actually pretty cheap. I was a little wary at first because when I looked at the ingredients to see what kind of peppers were used the first one listed was habanero. I'm not a fan of straight up habanero sauce. I've tried popular habanero hot sauces like El Yucateco and didn't like it. El Yucateco has a weird pungent smell to it that I can't get over and I find the taste somewhat off-putting. It's also too hot for me. But I saw on the label of Gringo Bandito that it uses a mix of various peppers so I figured it might be different.<br /><br />After tasting Gringo Bandito I was pleasantly surprised to find it doesn't taste the same as a regular habanero sauce. The smell is not sour or overpowering but rather has a nice spicy aroma. The combination of different peppers (habanero, jalapeno, red japanese chili, and more) seems to work well. It tastes good. It's got much more complexity than something like Tapatio. Tapatio's decent but has more of a vinegary taste to it. This is more balanced. It also has the perfect amount of medium heat to it; not weak and not too hot but still enough to give it a nice kick.<br /><br />So I like this stuff and recommend it wholeheartedly . I don't give it 5 stars because I don't love it like I do another hot sauce. My favorite hot sauce is the chile de arbol variety. The kind they give you at the taco shops that's orangish in color and comes in those round plastic containers. That's my absolute favorite but I haven't been able to find a good bottled version of it at the store. I would certainly keep buying this stuff though.

"Peanut Butter & Jelly is comforting isn't it?  Something about that mix can bring you back to your childhood or make you think of comfort food.  Sadly, this bar isn't quite what I expected, but it still has it's good points.<br /><br />I like the Larabars, they can be quite delicious.  That being said, I think I've discovered that the ones not involving fruit (i.e. peanut butter, chocolate, etc.) are not as good tasting.  This one, I did like the taste of cherries that was in it, and the touch of salt.  But the peanut flavor just wasn't as good.  It wasn't very sweet, which is fine, but it didn't really taste peanutty either.  Just an average mix of flavors.<br /><br />The ingredients in this bar are very good though.  There's only four.  Dates, peanuts, cherries and sea salt.  That's it.  Which is incredible.  I like foods like that that only have a few ingredients and nothing overly processed.  The bar has 210 calories.  So it's not a light snack.  This is better for while you are exercising or as a meal replacement.  I had it as breakfast and it worked just fine at filling me up.  There is 10 grams of fat in the bar and 19 grams of sugar.  So like I said before, not a light snack by any means.  It does have 4 grams of fiber though, so that's healthy.  And there's a little bit of natural vitamins in there from the fruit.  Protein is 6 grams, which isn't huge, but isn't bad for after you've been running (or before!).<br /><br />I probably wouldn't get this flavor again.  I'll stick to the all fruit bars I think when it comes to the Larabars.<br /><br />Review by M.

"I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients).

"This product is amazing!  We had a gift card for an out of town feed store and my husband happened to pick this up.  We have an older Rott/Boarder Collie who has been having joint, arthritis trouble.  The vet has given him several medications.  One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act ""wonky"".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by ""leaps and bounds"" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a ""treat"" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by-products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.

"Baird is my 1 year and few months old Shetland Sheepdog. His review of this product would involve a ton of tail wagging, enthusiastic sits, downs and any other trick he knows while he waits for me to hand him the treat!<br /><br />These treats seem to be really good. Baird loved them. They don't smell like dog treats. If you really sniff them yourself you can smell the hints of apple in them. Not having that nasty unnatural dog treat smell clinging to my hands for hours afterwards is a huge bonus as well.<br /><br />If you don't like to give your dog unnatural treats, this is definitely a good choice as every ingredient is certified organic. There is also NO CORN or other filler grains, which is also a bonus, especially if you ensure your dog isn't getting these grains in their regular meals. There's no point in keeping corn and similar grains out of their food if you're just going to hand off a treat that has those fillers.<br /><br />One down side is that, as other reviewers have stated, these treats are on the larger side. I'd say they are 1.5 x 1.5 inches in length and width once you break one in half. For a smaller dog, this might pose choking risks if they don't like to chew. I was worried about how Baird would handle them, but he's responsible in how he eats and chews everything really well. He's also a bit larger than a normal Sheltie. I plan on taking one over to my parents' house and giving it to their Sheltie Kiowa, as he is more the standard breed size for a Sheltie.<br /><br />I'd say, compared to say, Milk Bones, these treats are pretty pricey. However, with Milk Bones you get what you pay for; cheap treats. If you're OK giving your dog Milk Bones (I actually do as he enjoys them and I use them sparingly), you probably won't want to spend the money for these. If you try to ensure your dog has a healthy diet and want treats to match, these will definitely do the trick.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I received this, as it seems did many others, via Amazon Vine, which means I got the treats for free. This fact does not color my review as I treat every item from Vine as though I've paid for it. Plus I can't fake Baird's overly enthusiastic reaction.

"I initially purchased a package of this brownie mix from Walmart; it was on clearance. For years, I had no idea why I was always sick. One of the outstanding food problems was chocolate. Consequently, I did not eat it. I was not sad, but every now and again I would want to have a bite of it. It couldn't be too chocolately; it had to be more on the lines of a milk chocolate flavor. Anyway, I made these brownies tonight. Since I like cake-like brownies (not such a concentrated chocolate flavor), I made some changes. I did not use the recipe on the package. In place of the listed 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of milk. I also added 1/4 cup of water. I like cooked pecans, so I added slightly chopped pecans in the batter and some whole pecans on top. The result was really good brownies. I like the melted chunks of chocolate in brownies. My brownies were no where close to gritty. This may be due to the fact that I used milk (lactose-free) in place of the main water ingredient. Will buy again and use for events. It won't even be necessary to tell others it is gluten free until AFTER they've said how good they are.

They have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  I like the fact that they have some great ingredients, like cream and butter, but I had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them (I am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients).  As far as the taste goes, my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy, so I can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family.

"Obviously, one's preference for coffee is a personal thing. I happen to like this particular coffee very much. It is strong enough, but not bitter. I bought two boxes on sale, but the regular price of the K-cups has been rising beyond the point that I will spend for a homemade cup of coffee. Instead, I have been using pods for the Senseo machines. I got an adaptor for the Keureg, and they work fine for less than half the price.

"I don't understand why the flavors included in this variety pack are not listed in the Product Features section, just below the photo.  One has to read down PAST the legal disclaimers to find what flavors are included.  And even once one gets to the Product Features section which reveals the included flavors, one must first get past the hype:<br /><br />Product Description<br />Every refreshing variety lets you add flavor to you water without adding calories. These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Natural Lemonade, and Cherry Pomegranate<br /><br />Despite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless, I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.<br /><br />Crystal Light ""Natural"" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.<br /><br />""Natural"" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms, ""natural"" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural, it does ""taste"" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.<br /><br />Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.<br /><br />Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.<br /><br />Cherry Pomegranate: ditto<br /><br />My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here.

"Of all the Earl Grey's I've tried, this and Tazo's version are the most robust. If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont, but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend, and your not opposed to some extra tannins, then this or Tazo are your Earl Greys of choice. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont.

"I've been eating gluten free for about seven years, and a couple of Pamela's cookies with a cup of decaf have gotten me through my 4 p.m. ""low"" many times in those years. When I first discovered them, I loved all the shortbread styles. Then I moved into the chocolate chip versions. Most recently it was the peanut butter, with and without chips.<br /><br />I love them all, but this raisin and walnut cookie may be my all-time favorite. It's tender, chewy and generously studded with nuts and raisins. Unlike some of the others, which can be a little sweet for my taste, this one seems to rely on the raisins more than sugar for sweetness. After eating one or two, I feel like I've eaten something that might be good for me (and not just totally self-indulgent).<br /><br />Like all the Pamela's cookies, they're a little pricey, but the prices here on Amazon are definitely the best I've found.

"After FINALLY purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart.

"Ugh.<br /><br />We've been buying Happy Hips treats for our 14 year old black lab/springer spaniel mix for about a year because they are SO beneficial for her arthritis.  We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh, my gosh!<br /><br />The dog LOVES these treats!  She's ready to put on a tu-tu and prance around the kitchen to beg for them.  Forget the dignity afforded to canine senior citizens - this pooch is acting like her old juvenile self!  I don't know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won't go away!  Every time I turn around she's at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other ""flavors"" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like ""beef jerky"" - nope!  They're real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they're almost crystalline).  There's no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it's sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I'll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn't smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn't do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don't know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn't hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.

Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.

"I love Popchips!! They taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain.  I was introduced to the wonderful world of Popchips several months ago and I have not looked at regular chips the same.  I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips, however, I do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers. My family enjoys the Popchips so much, that I purchased a variety pack of 24 (0.8oz bags) from Amazon.  They taste very good and the texture is wonderful, although I will admit they are a bit salty.  I really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best, with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second.  Make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats, because as I stated before they are quite salty. I highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative.",i love popchips they taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain  i was introduced to the wonderful world of popchips several months ago and i have not looked at regular chips the same  i do not consume copious amounts of potato chips however i do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers my family enjoys the popchips so much that i purchased a variety pack of  oz bags from amazon  they taste very good and the texture is wonderful although i will admit they are a bit salty  i really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second  make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats because as i stated before they are quite salty i highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative,positive,positive
"I've had some gluten free foods that were terrible, but this is not one of them! These are amazing. My 8 y/o daughter has recently been put on a gluten free diet by her doctor for gluten intolerance (testing for Celiac also) and she was upset that she couldn't have ""anything worth eating"" anymore. I made her these brownies, and she said they were better than my recipe (which was a wheat based brownie)! Along with food intolerances she has high-functioning autism so she is very picky about textures, gritty food bothers her. I noticed a tiny texture difference from the wheat brownies but she gobbled them up anyway, they were THAT good. I made the ""original"" style, and it came out moist, soft, and just gooey enough but not undercooked. I like them better than wheat brownies, because you can cut these while they're still somewhat hot and they don't crumble!

"If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose.

"I read some reviews that claimed that this shake cause GI issues.<br /><br />Everyone has different sensitivities. My son has autism and according to his IgE and IgG panel test he has about 20 food sources that he has to avoid, such as: gluten (wheat, barley, rye), oats, milk, garlic, walnuts, sesame, grapefruit, coconut, and so on. I myself am sensitive to gluten and dairy and would get bloated and heartburn if I consume gluten or dairy. So this may not be the fault of this product because I found it to be a great product. I suggest if you have any GI issues you check with a good GI doctor, not just ANY GI doctor. The best GI doctor in the world is Dr. Arthur Krigsman. He practices either at Throughtful House in TX or in NYC. He has helped so many children with autism and addressed their GI issues that eventually the autistic behaviors improve. My son has been treated using simiar protocols by our DAN! doctor, Dr. Neubrander in NJ, and has recovered from autism just by cleaning his GI problems.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it would not use sugar. It uses sugar cane, but natural sugar or not it's still sugar. Sugar feeds yeast, and yeast causes GI and neurological issues (definitely behavior issues with my son). Signs of yeast overgrowth: dark circles under the eyes, red cheeks/ears, rashes/ezcema, hyperactivity, fatigue, craving for carbs and sugar, and so on (check out SCD diet on the Internet). I would rather use Stevia or Xylitol, so I wish this product didn't come sweetened. Xylitol actually has an added benefit, to prevent and fight cavities, since we don't use fluoride at home (fluoride is toxic, and it binds to calcium but it can't tell the difference between calcium and lead, so it increases metal retention in your body).

"Oh my goodness...I have an 11 year old pug/beagle mix that has been lethargic for about 3 years, wouldn't really play, had a dull coat no matter how much I groomed her, and has had itchy paws and armpits for a long time. I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD! THE PUPPY'S COAT ACTUALLY SPARKLES LIKE I PUT GLITTER ON HER IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT'S CRAZY. THE PUGGLE IS ONLY SHEDDING A THIRD OF WHAT SHE USED TO AND THE ONLY THING THAT SHE EVER CHEWS ON IS ONE OF HER PAWS AND THE VET GAVE ME A SPRAY FOR THAT.

"...but I love these things!  Bagged pork rinds from the grocery are beyond disgusting.  They don't look, smell or taste appealing.  But fresh nuked pork rinds are a very different story.

"The first time I tried this product to make pancakes, I thought it was terrible.  I made it according to the directions and used the ""right"" measuring cups for liquid and dry ingredients, but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy.  Then, one day when I was visiting my mother, she decided to make pancakes, and since I am GF, she had bought this mix for me (not knowing I had already hated it).  I saw that she measured the ingredients ""incorrectly"" as she used the same measuring cup (generally used to measure liquids) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  She also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  Amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and I really liked it.  In fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.  Having said that, both my husband and I are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products.

Used to drink Timothy's Parisian Nights, Midnight Magic and Green Mountains Dark Magic on medium water selection to get a strong enough brew, but now Barista Prima French Roast ONLY, on the large water setting.  Even with extra water it is perfect.  Little pricier than some of the others, but it is worth it, plus I get a full cup of coffee now when I brew on the large water setting.  I should also mention I only use filtered water when I brew my coffee, makes a huge difference.  Filtered water and a Barista Prima French Roast K-cup and it will by far blow everything else out of the water.  Nothing else compares.  If you like a really dark, smooth, flavorful coffee, you must try this.  You will not be disappointed.

"Upon opening the sealed bag, I was struck by an unpleasant scent.  Looking at the ingredients I saw, in addition to the black tea and rosebuds, a ""natural flavor"" additive.

"Yes, these cubes are expensive; in fact, I almost gave them four stars for the expense.  Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than ""cut"" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.

"We found these tablets to be pretty fun! I suggest dissolving a full tablet in your mouth, not cutting it in half as others suggested. And definitely be sure to move the tablet around your ENTIRE tongue...I missed the back of my tongue when dissolving the tablet so whenever I'd swallow I'd get a hint of the real flavor.<br /><br />However, it was definitely neat to see how the tablet changes your taste!! We tried lemons, limes, grapefruit, buffalo wing flavored potato chips, sour patch kids, warhead sour spray, dill pickles, oranges, whiskey, and wine. I found the ruby red grapefruit to be absolutely AMAZING. The dill pickles tasted so much like sweet pickles, I had to double check the jar to make sure they weren't! Pinot grigio was particularly delicious, as the tablet cut through the sour-ness turning it super sweet!!<br /><br />Oranges were okay, just tasted a little sweeter than normal. The lemons were still a bit sour but I found myself eating 4 slices of them, which I don't think I could have done without the tablets! I swear, the ruby red grapefruit was by far the best, in my opinion.<br /><br />We found that the more sour a food, the more drastic an effect. I definitely recommend trying these tablets with a full fridge so you can experience all types of foods! I'd say some grapefruit, lemons, and dill pickles are a must to try with these.<br /><br />They're great to try with friends, as the novelty wears off after one or two tries.

"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!<br /><br />First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!<br /><br />Not a good buy IMO.

"Although I think this pen is great...I didn't receive the entire roll of polytape..even after calling customer service...and I think the height of the posts is misleading..hence the 3 stars.  If I wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:<br /><br />Easy one-page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...<br /><br />I needed this portable paddock for my goats because I have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  I was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so I called Customer Service...The rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  However, several days later, I called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  This particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. But he said I could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that I have.  I have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.<br /><br />I have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldn't be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  However, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, I measured and they are actually 47 1/8  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  The tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  Seems awfully short for horses but I don't know anything about horses either.<br /><br />The instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  I did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  I had to call Customer Service, and the rep said that you CANNOT unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  Since I had already unrolled it to the end, I had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then it's not easy to untie that knot.<br /><br />In lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  Guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but I saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.<br /><br />My ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  It had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  The posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not break with normal use.  I did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.<br /><br />There is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so I called Customer Service back to find that out. He said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is NOT low impedance.  So, I had to mow where I wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  Not very practical when out on the road.<br /><br />Planning the fence was harder than I imagined because I couldn't make a perfect square and I thought I had measured correctly but still fell short of where I wanted the fence to end.  I then discovered that I was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  Doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.<br /><br />I wanted something that was easy.  I'm a small middle-aged female and needed something that wasn't too much trouble so I could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  This is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.

"If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",if you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder the instructions say to add one packet to  ounces of cold water but id recommend you try two packets and one packet  oz of stevia the flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor when you order this tea you will get six boxes with  packets in each if you use two packets per bottle of water you get  drinks that is only  cents per drink if you get free shipping  i ordered some books too i think that is fairly reasonable i look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices a website is given for additional recipes there are a few interesting recipes like the ones for white chocolate green tea ice cream green tea papaya nectar and green tea sugar cookies you will probably find many uses for this and ive even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea just use one packet per  ounces of hot water no brewing required this tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water i can highly recommend it to youbr br the rebecca review,positive,positive
"I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.<br />This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!<br />It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain. Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like.",i wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animalsbr this is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all  legged beings in my homebr it does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain dogs cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables and whyyyy do companies add sugarbeet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods it is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetesbr it is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amountsbr i like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogsbr no minus to this product other then the pricei can not afford to use it as much as i would like,positive,positive

"I love my Keurig coffee maker. And I enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGDM"">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Creme Caramel, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> seemed to be a safe choice. I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting. In short; the coffee taste is very mild, and the caramel taste isn't all that great.

"I love high-octane peanut butter, but not the fat/calorie content.<br /><br />TASTE: If you are accustomed to low-salt or raw products, the taste will be fine. If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.<br /><br />TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me).<br /><br />MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)<br /><br />USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.<br /><br />COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;)<br />BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a ""PRO"" because it helps with portion control.

"I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling.

"We spoil our dog. We drive twenty miles to get special food for our Great Dane. But for doggie treats (and doggie teeth cleaners), we've been buying off-the-shelf brands at the grocery store.

About doggie tidbits.<br /><br />The ingredients are organic so I can feel good about supporting the environment. The ingredients are wholesome. If I were not a vegetarian, I'd probably feel OK about eating them myself.<br /><br />Oh, and as I writer, I must mention that I love the marketing. It includes a little story on the back of the package. Let's call it creative nonfiction. No, let's call it fiction.

"From the way my two dogs inhaled these Newman's Own Organics Lam and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats, I would say that they are a hit with my canines.<br /><br />They were crunchy enough that the dogs at least had to chew them instead of swallowing them whole.

A couple of sniffs and then the treat disappeared.<br /><br />If I could change anything with the treats, I would love for them to come in a single bite instead of two biscuits together.

"I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat.

"I have been a fan of the More Than Gourmet product line for many years (I think since right about when they started) and this stock reduction is one of my favorites. Unlike their duck, chicken, veal, lamb and seafood products, this one can be added to almost anything. Soups, stews, sauces, what have you. This will add depth to all of the other More Than Gourmet stocks and glaces.<br /><br />They start with a classic ""essence de champignon"" (which is a mushroom stock containing sherry, salt, garlic and spices) and then they reduce it to 1/20 of it's volume. Since it is bound with a starch (Tapioca) it will help to add some body to a sauce. It can be used minimally diluted and poured over carrots, fish (really just about anything that would taste good with mushrooms), or added to an existing sauce or dish.<br /><br />I often make my own mayonnaise using safflower oil, egg yolks, Dijon mustard, lemon juice and various seasonings. I usually serve it as an elegant topping for fish or vegetables (it's great on asparagus) but I always thought that it could be better. I now add just a teaspoon of the More than Gourmet Essence De Champignon Gold and I can't believe how much better it is!<br /><br />I am a lifelong carnivore but some members of my family are vegetarians. When I cook for them I substitute this for a veal, chicken or beef demi-glace. I even add it to vegetable stock to give it that extra dimension. Sometimes I buy it in the 16 oz. tub, other times I like the convenience of the small 1.5 oz cups.

"Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet.

"If you are looking for a product that is going to help you lose weight, then perhaps look elsewhere. This drink has a lot of good ingredients in it, but like nearly everything out there on the market, it chiefly relies on thermogenics, with the main active of caffeine. Caffeine's effectiveness is affected by the fact that your body builds a tolerance to it, so as a weightloss ""program,"" the effectiveness of this product decreases over time (and you're only talking maybe 2 weeks here, depending on how often you take it).<br /><br />If, however, you are looking for an energy drink, I'd HIGHLY recommend Celsius. I started drinking this stuff a few years back before its distribution was up, and I've not been disappointed. It will definitely ramp you up, and because its very low sugar, you don't have the associated crash you get with drinks like Monster and Rockstar. Plus, the Ginger is a nice touch. I typically have big energy dips after meals, but it I drink one of these before or during a meal (like lunch), I don't experience the dip. My educated guess is that the ginger (which aids in digestion) is a big part of this, and it's an ingredient you don't find in other drinks.<br /><br />Tastes, vary from person to person, but I find Celsius's flavor strangely addictive. I drink the Wild Berry and the Sparkling Orange.<br /><br />Overall, this product gets my highest praises, and the shipping on it is lightning fast (like, 2 days to get to my door on regular shipping). Just know what you are putting into your body, and realize there is a fairly heavy dose of caffeine in this stuff (200 mg).",if you are looking for a product that is going to help you lose weight then perhaps look elsewhere this drink has a lot of good ingredients in it but like nearly everything out there on the market it chiefly relies on thermogenics with the main active of caffeine caffeines effectiveness is affected by the fact that your body builds a tolerance to it so as a weightloss program the effectiveness of this product decreases over time and youre only talking maybe  weeks here depending on how often you take itbr br if however you are looking for an energy drink id highly recommend celsius i started drinking this stuff a few years back before its distribution was up and ive not been disappointed it will definitely ramp you up and because its very low sugar you dont have the associated crash you get with drinks like monster and rockstar plus the ginger is a nice touch i typically have big energy dips after meals but it i drink one of these before or during a meal like lunch i dont experience the dip my educated guess is that the ginger which aids in digestion is a big part of this and its an ingredient you dont find in other drinksbr br tastes vary from person to person but i find celsiuss flavor strangely addictive i drink the wild berry and the sparkling orangebr br overall this product gets my highest praises and the shipping on it is lightning fast like  days to get to my door on regular shipping just know what you are putting into your body and realize there is a fairly heavy dose of caffeine in this stuff  mg,positive,positive

"And we find her here upon this grand amazon!<br /><br />Each day Morinu feeds me like my own nourishing mother, cherishes and consents my whims with this wonderful food.<br /><br />Eschew all animal byproducts and cadavers.<br /><br />This tofu is a strengthening food, fit for human consumption.<br /><br />And so convenient from our mighty amazon, sent right to your front porch or, in my case, post office box with free shipping rather than driving thirty to seventy five miles for the same product at three times the price, plus gas.<br /><br />This is fit food for humans, food for which our bodies are created, food which feeds us rather than kills both the source and the consumer.<br /><br />You may read here written by the self-deceived that this tofu is too mushy for firmness and that it must be pressed between towels before cooking. To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFCRU"">Corriander Seeds 7oz</a>, and a generous ladling of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ"">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RMB4WI"">Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added</a>. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that

"This is the greatest stuff on the planet. First off, I think it's the best silken tofu there is--firm silken will do all of your silken needs, basically. I use it to make mousses for desserts in my food processor. For instance, add some melted chocolate chips, some corn starch, add to a graham cracker crust: you've got a pie. Or I will add some peanut butter, cocoa powder and maple syrup to make a mousse. I also like to just add strawberries and bananas and maple syrup for a ""yogurt."" I use it to make ""sour cream"" and onion dips for vegetables. I also like it to make ""sour cream"" for Mexican food and potatoes--my omni boyfriend can't even tell the difference. Also good to make mayonnaise for potato salad. I recommend a food processor or blender to really get the smooth, creamy texture. This tofu is the best stuff on the planet. I order the 12 pack of it, because I got through 4 or more a week. Also, I like to get the organic, because soybeans are typically highly sprayed crops. It's worth the few extra bucks.

"Erythritol tastes like sugar, just like xylitol.  It is not, however, toxic to pets as xylitol is.  Also, it does not have the gastrointestinal effects (bloating, gas, etc.) that can come with intake of large quantities, as is the case with xylitol.  Both are quite safe for people, however.  Dogs cannot eat chocolate, either, due to toxicity, so xylitol is just another thing that works for us but not for them.  But erythritol is safe for both people and animals.<br /><br />The downside to erythritol is that it costs more than xylitol and is only 70% as sweet as sugar, whereas xylitol is closer to being the same sweetness as sugar.<br /><br />I haven't had much luck baking with either of them -- but maybe others have had different experiences.<br /><br />Both xylitol and erythritol taste great - I can't tell them from sugar.  Stevia is also a healthy sugar alternative, but it definitely has a taste -- not pleasant in large amounts (bitter).<br /><br />Not all brands of xylitol and erythritol are equal.  Many come from birch trees which often is extracted using sulfuric acid.  The ones from NOW Foods are from corn, which does not require sulfuric acid.<br /><br />This is a good company and I have been very happy with them.  On the other hand, I did not have a good experience with Emerald Forest's products or customer service.  Their products come from birch trees and have a very unpleasant odor.

"This review is based on my impression of the Newman's dog treats, and the reaction of my two dogs. The variables:<br /><br />1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed breed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth.<br />2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat.<br />3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like -- even so, they only eat small amounts.<br />4) When they are given a ""treat,"" it's not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw-hide stick -- never people food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn't smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to break in half; most of them were just too hard to snap -- and I have strong hands...I can't imagine someone with arthritis being able to break one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger breed, like a golden retriever, for instance.<br /><br />I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn't sure if the bag would affect my dogs' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn't see a reason why the dogs wouldn't like the treats.<br /><br />I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty break; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, ""you're not getting anything else for a treat,"" and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I've given them a whole biscuit every other day.

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>Delicious medium-roast blend with complex tones (5 stars)<br /><br />The name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.<br /><br />According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, ""created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck.""<br /><br />I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.<br /><br />In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands.

"I was a huge fan of PDQ eggnog crystals and was sad when this product quit being produced. I happened upon this product and I'm so glad I took a chance. At first I made just one glassful and enjoyed it but something was missing and some of the crystals did not completely dissolve. I decided to make a half gallon of 1% organic milk in it's carton while adding nutmeg, cinnamon, and 2 tsp. of organic vanilla. I let it refrigerate over night and what a difference. Now it tastes more like real eggnog and is such an inexpensive easy to make year round treat. So today I will order another 9 pack or maybe 2 since one never knows how long a product will be stocked. Also AMZN definitively has the BEST price as other charge three dollars for ONE container.

"I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem?

"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes.

"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia powder, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the Chia have helped?

"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.

"I tried this product after Switch's Watermelon-Strawberry drink, and while I thought that drink was decent, I was not a big fan of the Orange-Tangerine flavor.  The taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine, and for me that made it taste more Orange-ish than Orange.

After using erythritol in several recipes I've found that it tastes far better than alternate sweeteners like Splenda.  It is a little less sweet than sugar or Splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste.  The only problem with erythritol is that it doesn't break down easily in frostings or recipes that don't require some amount of cooking or baking.  I've found running it through a blender to break it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with.,after using erythritol in several recipes ive found that it tastes far better than alternate sweeteners like splenda  it is a little less sweet than sugar or splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste  the only problem with erythritol is that it doesnt break down easily in frostings or recipes that dont require some amount of cooking or baking  ive found running it through a blender to break it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with,positive,positive

I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket.

"I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half.  My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.

"These Honey Stingers are great.  I've used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour.  They do seem to provide some much-needed energy.

I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.

"So far I've only tried the Orange Tangerine flavor and it's pretty good overall.  It does have a tangerine taste to it, though it's accompanied by other flavors.  It's clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10% juice drinks since it's just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs. the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in something like Sunkist.  I think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage.  It does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange, but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider.  I think straight carbonated orange/tangerine juice would probably be a bit much.  The Switch reminds me of Appletiser, which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years, but is still pretty hard to find in the US.<br />That having been said, I had to dock one star for a couple of reasons.  First, the cans just seem too small.  If they're sticking with aluminum cans, I'd like to see the standard 12oz size offered.  It seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines.  Alternately, 16 or 20oz bottles would also work.  The second issue is the price.  While I understand there's a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup, the current price still seems high, even in comparison to other juice drinks.  That might be partly because it's from a relatively small company that doesn't yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of Coke and Pepsi can take advantage of, but it still seems like the price could come down a bit (or at least serving size could increase without a price increase) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume.<br />I pick up Appletiser when I can find it, and I'll likely do the same with The Switch, at least from time to time.",so far ive only tried the orange tangerine flavor and its pretty good overall  it does have a tangerine taste to it though its accompanied by other flavors  its clearly much more natural than regular soda or those  juice drinks since its just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors colors and preservatives in something like sunkist  i think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage  it does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider  i think straight carbonated orangetangerine juice would probably be a bit much  the switch reminds me of appletiser which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years but is still pretty hard to find in the usbr that having been said i had to dock one star for a couple of reasons  first the cans just seem too small  if theyre sticking with aluminum cans id like to see the standard oz size offered  it seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines  alternately  or oz bottles would also work  the second issue is the price  while i understand theres a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup the current price still seems high even in comparison to other juice drinks  that might be partly because its from a relatively small company that doesnt yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of coke and pepsi can take advantage of but it still seems like the price could come down a bit or at least serving size could increase without a price increase and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volumebr i pick up appletiser when i can find it and ill likely do the same with the switch at least from time to time,positive,neutral
"I love this sampler of Ghiradelli Chocolate Intense Dark Squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz. of dark chocolate each day that is over 70% cacoa.  Chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded--it's a bean!<br /><br />These chocolates are affordable, tasty, rich, intense, silky smooth and just the right size.  I love to serve them for after dinner.  The squares are fairly large and individually wrapped.  It's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes.  Dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some.  Of course, the darker the chocolate, the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86% cacoa. Great to have on hand for the holidays.  If you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat, having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation.

"I bought this drink locally and I have to tell you, they got it 'just right'. If you are like me and you like the flavor of vinegar, this drink will not disappoint, if you also like the flavor of grape.

I went back today and bought 5 more bottle of it at the local Co-op. Braggs is a highly regarded apple cider vinegar, so, to have that kind of base to start with means alot.

"I agree with the other reviewer, the preparation alone with these noodles would cause me to give them fewer then five stars. However, if they tasted like regular pasta with only 40 calories a bag, I could deal. Unfortunately, they are disgusting. I am a big fan of the cookbook author/food blogger Hungry Girl, and she uses these all the time so I had to try them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. They were very chewy (she told her fans this, so I was prepared for it), smelled nauseating when I opened the bag (rotting vegetables or fish smell maybe?), and had a bizarre taste. Regular pasta just kind of works as a texture filler for dishes, but these noodles had a strong and weird, chalky flavor. I will NEVER, EVER buy them again and will just settle for eating pasta dishes made with whole wheat noodles only once in a while.

"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!<br /><br />To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.

My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).<br /><br />Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).<br /><br />My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.

"I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.<br /><br />It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.<br /><br />I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.",i have not had pork rinds in more than  years and thought that this would be fun to try but i didnnt have high expectations microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success however i had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn  well it does  i dont have much with which to compare the taste  years ago however the texture and crispiness is just as i remembered i like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted these are not especially spicy but i used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the jobbr br it is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave  i have also found that  mins  seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rindsbr br i have eaten  bags of the pork rinds and i love them  they are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn  and each bag is only  carb,positive,positive
"The Switch Kiwi Berry,<br /><br />After tasting ""The Switch"" in Black Cherry, I was a little reluctant to even try the Kiwi Berry flavor. At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds.<br />I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste.<br />Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the ""Switch"" carbonated fruit juice drinks.<br />Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I don't care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also.

My cats, however, weren't as impressed as I was and turned their noses up at their new food. They did eat it, but clearly weren't enthused.<br />Although I like the human grade ingredients used in Halo foods, I do wish they used more meat sources.

"One of my favorite but rare indulgences is a can of orange soda; so I was looking forward to the combination of bubbles and orange flavor when I popped open my can of Switch Orange Tangerine. To my disappointment, it tasted more like fruit punch, perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it. I would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the apple-grape combo, not just in the flavor department, but in the sweetness. It's sticky icky sweet, more than any of the cheaper brands (Sunkist, Crush and others) of orange soda, or the higher priced goodies like Orangina and the delectable Izze.<br /><br />It is fairly healthy however, with no bad stuff and quite a lot of Vitamin C (100% based on 2,000 calorie intake), All Natural, etc. My recommendation is for more orange, less apple/grape, or change the label flavor to ""mixed fruit."" It's 140 calories per cute little 8.3 oz can, and if you're not expecting orange you may like it. So far, the taste winner for cute little cans for me is Izze's Grapefruit, which has the perfect balance of flavor and carbonation, with the right amount of sweetness.",one of my favorite but rare indulgences is a can of orange soda so i was looking forward to the combination of bubbles and orange flavor when i popped open my can of switch orange tangerine to my disappointment it tasted more like fruit punch perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it i would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the applegrape combo not just in the flavor department but in the sweetness its sticky icky sweet more than any of the cheaper brands sunkist crush and others of orange soda or the higher priced goodies like orangina and the delectable izzebr br it is fairly healthy however with no bad stuff and quite a lot of vitamin c  based on  calorie intake all natural etc my recommendation is for more orange less applegrape or change the label flavor to mixed fruit its  calories per cute little  oz can and if youre not expecting orange you may like it so far the taste winner for cute little cans for me is izzes grapefruit which has the perfect balance of flavor and carbonation with the right amount of sweetness,neutral,neutral

"I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great ""hearty"" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed.

"This generously sized, 7 ounce bar is covered in dark chocolate-a superb combination.<br /><br />Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar makes the best Marzipan.

"I can't imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item. If you haven't tried it you must, it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake. It has a very different flavor than any BBQ sauce on the market, a flavor all it's own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish. I have made stuffing, mashed potatoes (a favorite) and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chicken.It's perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion. I am always afraid that they will stop making it, it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it, kids all seem to love it and I love it because it is quick and easy. It's a very unique flavor, I want to say a little sweeter than most BBQ sauces or flavorings but not really sweet , kind of like a honey BBQ but better, that can be used on pork chops as well. There is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but I find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken , a lot of wasted mix that way. I put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed, then I rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating (shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated) and then place them into a baking pan that I line with foil, it makes clean up much easier after cooking, almost don't need to wash the pan this way.Try to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken. Any mix left in the packet I shake on pieces that don't look completely covered and then just on top of all of them. I usually get a package of about 3 or 4 half breasts and a package of 6 thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate. It becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate, your fingers and of course the chicken pieces. I have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too, but honestly you don't need to add anything it is delicious the way it is. Cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it doesn't sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results. I would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think.",i cant imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item if you havent tried it you must it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake it has a very different flavor than any bbq sauce on the market a flavor all its own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish i have made stuffing mashed potatoes a favorite and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chickenits perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion i am always afraid that they will stop making it it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it kids all seem to love it and i love it because it is quick and easy its a very unique flavor i want to say a little sweeter than most bbq sauces or flavorings but not really sweet  kind of like a honey bbq but better that can be used on pork chops as well there is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but i find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken  a lot of wasted mix that way i put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed then i rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated and then place them into a baking pan that i line with foil it makes clean up much easier after cooking almost dont need to wash the pan this waytry to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken any mix left in the packet i shake on pieces that dont look completely covered and then just on top of all of them i usually get a package of about  or  half breasts and a package of  thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate it becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate your fingers and of course the chicken pieces i have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too but honestly you dont need to add anything it is delicious the way it is cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it doesnt sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results i would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think,positive,positive

"This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.)

Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative.

"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com"" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food.

"I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company.

"Bull Dog's Chuno has become a flavorful addition to my kitchen.  I've used it in everything: marinades, rice, stir fries, vegetables, etc.  I've also used it by itself or as a base to dipping sauces.  It also adds a nice component to homemade bbq sauce.

"I have relied on Canidae for my 4 dogs for over 3 years now. It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic.  The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now.

"I like the Senseo coffee machine and believe that it can make very good coffee. However, I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts. The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh. The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak, watery brew.

The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior, in my view.

"This product has many claims, making it appear healthy. A quick look at the nutritional information, however, shows somewhat otherwise. Each bar is 180 calories, which is a good mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. Total fat, though, is 9g, with 2g saturated fat. Fortunately, it provides 2g of fiber and 2g of protein.

"The Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo capsules are awesome. This is a strong coffee, a caffe lungo is a ""long coffee"" or big coffee that Europeans drink. It's like their everyday coffee. The caffe lungo is meant to be a stronger tasting, somewhat bitter coffee. It means business. So if you like a strong, slightly bitter coffee in the morning like I do, it's wonderful. Now. Because the Dolce Gusto machine lets YOU decide how much water to add, you can further control the strength and therefore bitterness. Obviously, the more water you add, the more mild the coffee will be. I suggest that when you first get the machine, you experiment with strength by using a pyrex measuring cup. They suggest adding 4oz of water, but obviously you can add however much or however little water your heart desires to suit your tastes. Apparently, Europeans are not sitting around enjoying big mugs like Americans are. I think they simply drink more cups throughout the day.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a wonderful, full-bodied and slightly bitter coffee. I makes a wonderful crema layer.

"While looking for a top rated vanilla K-cup, I stumbled upon this combination flavored cup that was rated higher than any of the vanilla flavored cups at that time.  I took a chance and ordered a double pack from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised. This is a rich tasting medium/light roasted flavor that appeals to several coffee drinkers at our house. There is a hint of built in sweetness so that additional sweeteners are not necessary for those of us who don't care for super sweet coffee. I would classify this as a medium roast and tastes best with the medium sized cup selections on our Keurig Coffee Brewer<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6"">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a>.

"I highly recommend these very tasty Kavli Thin Crispbreads. I wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches. I hate whole wheat. I love rye. I saw these, noticed the ingredients couldn't get much simpler and gave them a try. Topped with cheese, or a sandwich spread or whatever you'd like they're very tasty. I feel as full after 2 or 3 of these, topped of course, as I did with just white bread. They're nice and thin so it isn't like biting into anything hard - just a nice crunch. The flavor isn't strong at all - it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past. Then I noticed that they are only 20 calories per slice. What's not to love? They taste good, they're whole grain, they're super low in calories, it's no crunchier than a potato chip, and I feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them. Oh - and they keep forever in the cupboard.

"To everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k-cups, here's the trick.  Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad.",to everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these kcups heres the trick  put it in your machine close the lid open the lid turn  degrees close the lid and repeat two more times  you should have closed the lid on the kcup four times by now  next step is to hit the brew button  the problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through  with the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good  would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to  could have been a little thicker overall but not bad,positive,positive

"I've been a fan of the Melitta system for years. It's simple, and eliminates the expense of an<br />appliance. For one or two persons, it's a great way to make coffee. I have always used regular<br />grind coffee with a Melitta basket, but the Classique Supreme has changed my mind. Melitta's<br />coffee is ground very finely, almost to a powder consistency, which works better with their<br />drip basket system. I often ran the water through twice with regular grind, but don't need to<br />do so with the Melitta coffee. Whenever I can eliminate a step, I'm happy.<br /><br />This particular Melitta coffee, the Classique Supreme, has a rich flavor compared to the<br />rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to. Taken black, it has a smoky, vaguely<br />Espressoesque flavor that I find quite delicious. Adding a little creamer (I use the<br />liquid variety) cuts that flavor considerably. The package directions specify two level<br />teaspoons per six-ounce cup, which I find inadequate; twice that amount is much better.<br />Classique Supreme may be a bit pricey, and there may well be better ""gourmet"" coffees<br />out there, but it works for me, and I certainly would get it again in the future.<br /><br />My only complaint: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents.",ive been a fan of the melitta system for years its simple and eliminates the expense of anbr appliance for one or two persons its a great way to make coffee i have always used regularbr grind coffee with a melitta basket but the classique supreme has changed my mind melittasbr coffee is ground very finely almost to a powder consistency which works better with theirbr drip basket system i often ran the water through twice with regular grind but dont need tobr do so with the melitta coffee whenever i can eliminate a step im happybr br this particular melitta coffee the classique supreme has a rich flavor compared to thebr rather ordinary coffees that ive gotten used to taken black it has a smoky vaguelybr espressoesque flavor that i find quite delicious adding a little creamer i use thebr liquid variety cuts that flavor considerably the package directions specify two levelbr teaspoons per sixounce cup which i find inadequate twice that amount is much betterbr classique supreme may be a bit pricey and there may well be better gourmet coffeesbr out there but it works for me and i certainly would get it again in the futurebr br my only complaint the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents,positive,positive

"Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights"" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather.

"Well, I have to say that I thought this would be pretty bad. I admit it.<br />Deconstituted peanuts - wow. Dry, tasteless, useless, but less fat.<br /><br />I have to say that I was wrong!<br />It smells pretty darned good when you open the jar up. It is powder, so<br />I used a knife to only cut half the lid off. That way, if my fumble fingers<br />dropped the jar, I would not spill as much of this - it is pretty pricey.<br /><br />I like peanut butters, but don't eat enough of it to really use it up before<br />it separates into oil/goo.  This is the answer for me. You just mix up what you need!<br /><br />Basically, this is just powder that mixes with water. While directions say two Tbls of powder<br />to one Tbl of water, who wants to really measure peanut butter? Best eyeball judging that I could<br />say for advice, is to get a small bowl, and put enough water in it to be about the amount<br />that you want to have of peanut butter. Use a spoon or fork, either one. Sprinkle the<br />powder over the water generously and mix, mix, mix. If it is too runny for your desired use,<br />sprinkle a little more powder and mix again. Repeat until it is just like you want it. I did find<br />that I had to mix it more than I thought I would to get the desired consistency/texture. If you<br />don't mix it enough, it will feel grainy to the tongue.<br /><br />The freedom to have it slightly runny for dipping, or thicker for spreading, is so nice!<br />While I honestly thought I wouldn't like it, I really do. I made a small batch up, intending to<br />dip my finger in it for taste testing. This is how I learned about not putting so much water in the bowl.<br />I had more peanut butter than I really wanted. So, son and I whipped out a package of Ritz crackers<br />and thoroughly enjoyed dipping/spreading it on the crackers. There was only the color of the bowl<br />left when we were through!<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about it, especially since it is a little costly, just jump in.<br />I can't see any waste in this product (except maybe spilling it). If you are trying to watch your<br />fat intake, this is the PB to eat.<br /><br />I have ordered a jar of the PB2 Chocolate tonight. I simply have to try it too. I hope it is as good<br />as this one!  YUM!

Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.,many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in new zealand it is now made in the us by performance pet products i have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of  and prior to the change it was excellent food and i was thrilled with it since ziwipeak has been switched to canning in the us it has been a nightmare several times in the last year i have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour i had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools also recently i have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue ive contacted the us distributor twice but they have never replied a batch i got this month with an expiry date of  has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy,negative,negative

"; the problem with this mix -- and to mind, the only problem! -- is the inclusion of one or two slightly sugary little... things.

It all tastes rather waxy, and I'm sure is not the healthiest food in the world (though you could do worse), but its a well combined mixture.<br /><br />But then again, I've got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace, because I must grab a handful, and then separate the rejects.

We've asked about his dedication to Yuban coffee to which he replies, ""it's perfect black, but better with something in it!"" He is apparently referring to its flavor when mixed with any of the typical 'southern flavorings' (taxed and untaxed, regulated and unregulated) that he occasionally adds to his morning brew.

"It has been said, that dogs often show signs of their owner's personality and quirks---that our bad behaviors become their own.  In fact, my dog's Vet recently told me, that if he sees an obese dog, he can just glance at the owner, and they will often share the problem.  Not only that, but I've seen photos of dogs and owners, where I swear there was a shared physical resemblance.  What do we try to do, make our dogs into a little mini-me?  With this sudden jarring epiphany, I think we're in trouble here.<br /><br />Although my dog is far from a 'mini-me,' at 126 lbs and 30"" tall, given the opportunity to select a healthy, organic snack, over an inferior product, well...let me just make this analogy.  If I'm really having a craving for a snack, and there is a bag of Cheetos in the cabinet, I'm more likely to grab them, than the 'all natural' carrot sticks and celery in the veggie drawer. Enough said, and I clearly know better.  My Shepherd doesn't. He eats a high quality food, but I have let him dictate his treats, based on his observable level of enjoyment. In essence---we DO spoil our dogs, and ourselves.<br /><br />In test after test, given the opportunity to select the 'Newman's Own' treat, over my dog's favorite bargain brand---okay, Milk Bones, he would go for the MB every single time. But, toward the end of the bag of Newman's Own, I began to notice a change in enthusiasm.  Maybe eating healthy for humans and dogs, alike, is an aquired taste, or simply a change in habits.<br /><br />Will I purchase Newman's Own, after this trial? Absolutely! I'm sold on the all natural ingredients, the absence of chemicals and the product analysis. The only thing I found missing from the product description is the calorie count, with recommendations for appropriate number of treats, daily, which I think is important for managing weight. Although with the few 'natural' ingredients listed (Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Apples, Organic Palm Oil and Organic Molasses, preserved with Mixed Tocopherols---a source of Vi E) I doubt the calorie count could be that high, as these are not large treats.<br /><br />These treats are hard, and dense, which gave my dog a good dental workout, even with his mouth the size of a small alligator. Of course, it was gone in just a minute (but so is everything else), but smaller dogs would likely enjoy chewing on one of these for a while.<br /><br />I say, give them a try. You won't find anything healthier (per the product description), unless you decide to make your own dog biscuits, which many of my friends are now doing. But, doing so, wouldn't be more cost effective, because you would need to purchase all organic, while baking them in small batches due to preservative issues.",it has been said that dogs often show signs of their owners personality and quirksthat our bad behaviors become their own  in fact my dogs vet recently told me that if he sees an obese dog he can just glance at the owner and they will often share the problem  not only that but ive seen photos of dogs and owners where i swear there was a shared physical resemblance  what do we try to do make our dogs into a little minime  with this sudden jarring epiphany i think were in trouble herebr br although my dog is far from a minime at  lbs and  tall given the opportunity to select a healthy organic snack over an inferior product welllet me just make this analogy  if im really having a craving for a snack and there is a bag of cheetos in the cabinet im more likely to grab them than the all natural carrot sticks and celery in the veggie drawer enough said and i clearly know better  my shepherd doesnt he eats a high quality food but i have let him dictate his treats based on his observable level of enjoyment in essencewe do spoil our dogs and ourselvesbr br in test after test given the opportunity to select the newmans own treat over my dogs favorite bargain brandokay milk bones he would go for the mb every single time but toward the end of the bag of newmans own i began to notice a change in enthusiasm  maybe eating healthy for humans and dogs alike is an aquired taste or simply a change in habitsbr br will i purchase newmans own after this trial absolutely im sold on the all natural ingredients the absence of chemicals and the product analysis the only thing i found missing from the product description is the calorie count with recommendations for appropriate number of treats daily which i think is important for managing weight although with the few natural ingredients listed organic barley organic lamb organic carrots apples organic palm oil and organic molasses preserved with mixed tocopherolsa source of vi e i doubt the calorie count could be that high as these are not large treatsbr br these treats are hard and dense which gave my dog a good dental workout even with his mouth the size of a small alligator of course it was gone in just a minute but so is everything else but smaller dogs would likely enjoy chewing on one of these for a whilebr br i say give them a try you wont find anything healthier per the product description unless you decide to make your own dog biscuits which many of my friends are now doing but doing so wouldnt be more cost effective because you would need to purchase all organic while baking them in small batches due to preservative issues,positive,positive

I ordered this bouquet for valentine's day and was happy to see how great this arrangement looks once it blooms.  you should expect all the flowers to arrive unopened and they mostly bloomed in 2-3 days.  I received 14 stargazer lilies and 19 irises.  the glass vase was simple but functional and attractive.  2 packets of plant nutrients were included and i expect the flowers will last at least a week (5 days so far).  all i did was cut the flowers under running water and plop them in the vase with 1 packet of food.  you could arrange them yourself for slightly better results.,i ordered this bouquet for valentines day and was happy to see how great this arrangement looks once it blooms  you should expect all the flowers to arrive unopened and they mostly bloomed in  days  i received  stargazer lilies and  irises  the glass vase was simple but functional and attractive   packets of plant nutrients were included and i expect the flowers will last at least a week  days so far  all i did was cut the flowers under running water and plop them in the vase with  packet of food  you could arrange them yourself for slightly better results,positive,positive

"I want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink I've ever had.  That said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but don't like some of the ingredients.  Switch has attempted to address this concern and I feel it's a step in the right direct.  This is an Orange Tangerine flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar, preservatives, corn syrup, or caffeine.  In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking real orange juice.<br /><br />The can is also thinner then a soda can so you're not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke.  This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free.  It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you.  While not a perfect drink it's one I enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future.",i want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink ive ever had  that said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but dont like some of the ingredients  switch has attempted to address this concern and i feel its a step in the right direct  this is an orange tangerine flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar preservatives corn syrup or caffeine  in other words this is about as natural as you can get without you know drinking real orange juicebr br the can is also thinner then a soda can so youre not getting as much liquid as you would a pepsi or coke  this means there is less fat in each can and the makers claim the product is glutton free  it does have a bit of a weird aftertaste but after a few sips it stops bothering you  while not a perfect drink its one i enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future,neutral,positive

"I've been buying Dogswell chew treats for my dog for several years. She's always loved them. The most recent time I purchased them, however, she got seriously ill, with heavy vomiting and lethargy. I almost forgot about it, but a few weeks later I found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again. She got very ill again. Especially since she's rarely sick, it's difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness.  Unless and until there's some quality control on these, I highly recommend finding a different treat. As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china.

I had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma, but it smelled pretty good once I got my nose in there.<br /><br />I set out to brew myself a pot.  I followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me.  Now usually I do not drink decaffeinated, so I was just a little concerned. Decaf to me can taste very flat. But I waited and a nice smell filled the air.  Finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product. My husband smiled. He loves any coffee that has Arabica beans. He looked at me and said, ""ummm this is really good.""  My turn.  I sniffed some more, I'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body.  It still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test.<br /><br />Okay, it was definitely different than the Dunkin  Donuts coffee that I'm use to and love. However,it had a smooth flavor, but  a little richer than I like and I didn't seem to notice that it was decaf, that was a good thing.  It was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee.

"Newman's Own has been an excellent choice for my dog. The ingredients are organic and high quality; her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vet's office. Also, she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew.  It was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery, but Amazon made an immediate adjustment.  I like the 4-pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much, but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs.",newmans own has been an excellent choice for my dog the ingredients are organic and high quality her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vets office also she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew  it was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery but amazon made an immediate adjustment  i like the pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs,positive,positive

"We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a ""catkins"" diet.  Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved.  The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong ""Call of the Wild"" into the meat.<br /><br />Surprisingly, they love quail.  Far more than chicken, and a bit more than turkey.

"So, ideally we'd all make gravy totally from scratch using only the pan drippings from whatever meat we're cooking, but... sometimes you just don't get that much in the way of pan drippings, and yet you want LOTS of gravy. And sometimes you're cooking, say, sausages (bangers & mash, anyone??) or something else that isn't going to result in juices you can make gravy from, and yet you still require a big jug of gravy to pour over everything. Lucky for all concerned, the marvellous product that is Bisto exists. I'm English (but have lived in the US for the past several years) and am very happy that this product is reasonably easy to obtain over here. My American husband is an enormous fan and starts to get a bit worried if we don't have at least one unopened tub of Bisto in the cupboard, lest he should want bangers & mash or toad in the hole for dinner and find we're unable to make enough gravy to float a small boat to accompany it.<br /><br />Bisto does come in a few different varieties, but these ""favourite"" granules are the original and work really well as an all-purpose gravy. I prefer to use this version no matter what meat I'm cooking - it works just as well with chicken or turkey as it does with beef or with pork sausages, and it's an essential ingredient in shepherd's pie (lamb), cottage pie (beef), steak ""pot"" pie (as they call it over here), you can throw a spoonful in the crockpot when making a stew... it's very versatile and adds a lovely rich, deep flavor to all kinds of dishes.<br /><br />When making gravy, you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way (boil kettle, pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of Bisto granules, stir quickly) but for REALLY good gravy I prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter (just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan) until it caramelises slightly, then dump in the Bisto granules and boiling water, give it a good stir, and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go. Only takes a few minutes. Even better is if you use the water from boiling vegetables and stir in meat juices from the roasting pan if you have some, but it works just as well without.<br /><br />The downside of this product (if you care about such things) is that it's pretty high on the sodium content and has a few artificial flavorings etc in there. As far as I'm concerned: meh. It tastes great, I'm sparing with the salt just about everywhere else in my diet, and I don't use Bisto in great enough quantities to worry about it.<br /><br />In short: Bisto is a wonderful taste of home, and while I could live without it, I'd really rather not!",so ideally wed all make gravy totally from scratch using only the pan drippings from whatever meat were cooking but sometimes you just dont get that much in the way of pan drippings and yet you want lots of gravy and sometimes youre cooking say sausages bangers  mash anyone or something else that isnt going to result in juices you can make gravy from and yet you still require a big jug of gravy to pour over everything lucky for all concerned the marvellous product that is bisto exists im english but have lived in the us for the past several years and am very happy that this product is reasonably easy to obtain over here my american husband is an enormous fan and starts to get a bit worried if we dont have at least one unopened tub of bisto in the cupboard lest he should want bangers  mash or toad in the hole for dinner and find were unable to make enough gravy to float a small boat to accompany itbr br bisto does come in a few different varieties but these favourite granules are the original and work really well as an allpurpose gravy i prefer to use this version no matter what meat im cooking  it works just as well with chicken or turkey as it does with beef or with pork sausages and its an essential ingredient in shepherds pie lamb cottage pie beef steak pot pie as they call it over here you can throw a spoonful in the crockpot when making a stew its very versatile and adds a lovely rich deep flavor to all kinds of dishesbr br when making gravy you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way boil kettle pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of bisto granules stir quickly but for really good gravy i prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan until it caramelises slightly then dump in the bisto granules and boiling water give it a good stir and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go only takes a few minutes even better is if you use the water from boiling vegetables and stir in meat juices from the roasting pan if you have some but it works just as well withoutbr br the downside of this product if you care about such things is that its pretty high on the sodium content and has a few artificial flavorings etc in there as far as im concerned meh it tastes great im sparing with the salt just about everywhere else in my diet and i dont use bisto in great enough quantities to worry about itbr br in short bisto is a wonderful taste of home and while i could live without it id really rather not,positive,positive

"If you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product. Hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts. These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the ""sweet spot"" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me.

Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time.

"It really is!  I am not a fan of carbonated drinks because most of them are simply not healthy.  I even know people who have developed physical problems because of too much consumption of them, especially those who even drink them as a starter in the morning.<br /><br />BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT. It has a real full-bodied orange/ tangerine flavor, although the label says it is combined with other juice concentrates:  apple, grape and acerola juice (I had to look that one up:  it is the cherrylike fruit of a small tree of the West Indies which has a high concentration of vitamin C).  Anyway, it's just darned good!<br /><br />I experimented a little on the best way to serve.  I drank it cold as is, then poured it over a glass of ice cubes.  Neither of those ways seemed quite right.  Then I poured the beverage on ice, left it for a minute, then removed the ice by pouring juice through a strainer.  This left it nice and chilled, not just cold, and not weakened by melting ice.<br /><br />I live in the Colorado Desert where temperatures are scorching in the summers.

"Vegan. Natural. Spicy snack mix also with sweet flavor notes. Americans might find it spicy, but for Indians it is quite mild and more towards the sweet side. If you like Indian flavors and spicy snacks along with some sweetness, you might really enjoy this one! Haldiram is a top snack brand in India. Khatta Meeta is my top favorite Indian snack mix. Made with gram flour, peanut oil, corn oil, peanuts, rice flakes, sago [palm stem starch], sugar, green peas, gram pulse, lentil, salt, mango powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, ginger powder, black pepper powder, & citric acid powder. Was very happy to be able to order from Amazon rather than to wait until I find myself back in India or in a large metro with an Asian market. Walking on the streets in India, you can find the small and big packets of Haldiram snacks nearly everywhere. Halidram's also has one of my favorite sweet shops in Kolkata [Calcutta] near to one of my friend's house and office.  Great for vegan traveling. Approx 1120 calories, 20g protein per bag. Product of India. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

We have been feeding our dog Newman's Own since she was very young.  She was a finiky eater and I was a determined owner who insisted on organic food.  Both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product.  It's the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be 9 years old next month.  The only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots.

I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the ""World Market"" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3.

"I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.<br /><br />New Rating:<br />Canidae - 0 stars<br />California Natural - 5 stars<br />Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good).",i started feeding my dogs canidae all life stages dry dog food almost  years ago prior to that i used nutromax wow what an amazing food my german shepherd and  golden retrievers have the most incredible coats their poops are firm and easy to pick up and nearly odorless no allergies either unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems ive convinced one person to change to canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it i buy it locally as i go thru  pounds every  weeks feeding  large dogs i highly recommend this food could not be happierbr br update canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late  and at the same time in order to save money changed their formulas added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and gi problems the organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about canidae than any manufacturer in recent history due to their formula change a fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about  of the canidae bags back from owners w pets having problems w the new formula all  of my dogs had bad reactions and i even did a gradual change over because i was told ahead of time by my friend that they changed the formula diarrhea vomiting itching scratching my one golden scratched himself raw to the point i had to take him to the vet after using canidae for many years and recommending it to many others i decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it i switched to using california natural lamb and rice and orijen adult two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available both company control the ingredients manufacture the food have numerous quality checkpoints and do their own distribution my dogs are different ages and have different needs so i do a blend of the calnat and orijen and  wow what a difference their coats are shiny their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free and they love it both are great foods a bit more expensive than other foods but to me worth every penny cal nat and orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion if you are considering canidae id recommend you look at cal nat or orijen insteadbr br new ratingbr canidae   starsbr california natural   starsbr orijen   stars id give orijen  stars if i could it really is that good,positive,positive

"I went on a search for Japanese Black Sugar (from Okinawa) after my local Japanese Markets all stopped carrying it. I was introduced to black sugar while living with a girl from Kyoto for 3 years. She preferred using black sugar because she believed it was rich in minerals (I cannot confirm or verify this), but I came to prefer it in my coffee. bigtime. The taste is quite unlike other sugar.. with a strong molasses taste. the blocks are often darker on the outside, however, the taste is unmistakable, and this is quite definitely Black Sugar.<br />I am a bit of a coffee connoisseur, and I prefer to drink my coffee with real japanese black sugar or ""Kuro Sato"".<br />When I last ordered this product, it qualified for Free Super Saver shipping, which made it a good deal.

"Corn is BAD for dogs!  When I learned that, I switched immediately to food that doesn't have any in it (and most well known, readily available brands do).<br /><br />Our dog is very sensitive, and while she seemed to be doing well with BB's Wilderness Chicken, her poo smelled to the high heavens.  I read that it's often due to their not digesting chicken well; I guess she doesn't.  So, I switched her to the Lamb/Brown Rice formula.

"I've never been a fan of kiwi & strawberry together, but I think Switch got it right by combining fruit juice with carbonation.  I am a big fan!  It was a little bit too sweet, but I'm hoping other flavors will tone that done a little.  I suspect that the 135 calories for this perfectly sized can is due to the fruit itself, and not added sugar, although there is acerola in it - which is also known as the Puerto Rican Cherry.  That means no added sugar at all.

"We started our son on baby food a little after his 6 month birthday.  (he is almost 8 months now)  After introducing avocado and quinoa cereal, we tried NuturMe's squash, and it was a huge hit.

"Note: This is my first review of a product that is not a book, so please forgive me if I miss something.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of fruit drinks like The Switch, but I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. After having my first drink, I can honestly say I wanted to hate it. I mean, seriously, I'm drinking this can of 100% fruit juice with carbonation and reading all these really stupid quotes all over the can (i.e. ""100% of what I want in a soda, 0% of what I don't""), wondering how much a 8.3 ounce can of this junk costs (thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.50 or $3.00; and thinking, if I wanted to drink some juice and would drink some juice! I couldn't stop thinking about what is so special about carbonation that I would want to drink this over a glass of OJ. I wanted to scream!<br /><br />However, I kept my cool, and finished the drink. There was something about this particular flavor that was enjoyable, but not engrossing. There was something in the aftertaste that I did not like, and I think it had to do with the tangerine juice. Tangerine's aren't my bag, either; but it was tolerable.<br /><br />After discussing this product with my wife (I know, this drink apparently also contains the conversation starter attributes, bonus points for that I suppose) she was like, ""this sounds great. Is it like those <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IW25RK"">Izze POMEGRANATE SPARKLING 100% JUICE DRINK</a>??"" I responded: ""Um.... I guess so...""<br /><br />I then also looked up the price and learned that I had grossly overestimated the price of a single can (being just over a single dollar). Despite my wanting to hate this product, I've decided to step out of my anti-contemporary culture box, view this product for what it is, and give it a middle rating of 3 stars.<br /><br />I can see the attraction; I can see the appeal; I just won't ever buy it.

"this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go! we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infant--it is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag. now that my daughter is older, she is able to feed herself with the pouch. just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeeze/suck the fruit out of it. not only is the packaging great, but the fruit tastes good as well (and yes, I have tasted everything that I feed my daughter). my daughter loves this--her whole face lights up when I hand her a pouch.",this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infantit is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag now that my daughter is older she is able to feed herself with the pouch just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeezesuck the fruit out of it not only is the packaging great but the fruit tastes good as well and yes i have tasted everything that i feed my daughter my daughter loves thisher whole face lights up when i hand her a pouch,positive,positive

"Our 9 month old originally was spitting up a lot. We had him 1st on Similac regular, then went to Similac Sensitive and finally to Similac Soy.  The soy did the trick. He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don't need SOY anymore if that's what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby's only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thank's to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.  I am happy about that since SOY can cause some hormonal problems.....babies and adults alike.

"The oatmeal itself is tasty and pretty healthful.  It's not the best oatmeal I've ever had, but it is quite good.  And it is great to see yet another vegan-certified product on the market.  This is a great option for busy vegans (like me!) looking for a quick breakfast.  You can probably make better oatmeal from scratch, but it would take a lot longer.  So, really, this is a good product.<br /><br />But I have two (somewhat related) complaints.<br /><br />First, the serving size is *ridiculously* small.  Each packet of oatmeal is about 120 calories.  That's just silly.  Unless you're a child, or you're planning on eating much more than oatmeal for breakfast (or adding significant quantities of fruit to your oatmeal), you'll want to open a couple of packs each time you sit down.  That's a bit annoying.  (You could solve this one problem by buying the larger cups.  But they're a much worse value, calorie-for-dollar.  And the second problem, below, still applies.)<br /><br />Second, there is so much packaging and unnecessary waste.  It's absurd that ~50 ounces of oatmeal is spread out over six boxes, each of which contains eight microscopic paper bags of oatmeal.<br /><br />These problems could be solved by just selling single-container bags of oatmeal.  The result would be less waste and packaging and an easier time serving.<br /><br />Still, overall, this is a good product.",the oatmeal itself is tasty and pretty healthful  its not the best oatmeal ive ever had but it is quite good  and it is great to see yet another vegancertified product on the market  this is a great option for busy vegans like me looking for a quick breakfast  you can probably make better oatmeal from scratch but it would take a lot longer  so really this is a good productbr br but i have two somewhat related complaintsbr br first the serving size is ridiculously small  each packet of oatmeal is about  calories  thats just silly  unless youre a child or youre planning on eating much more than oatmeal for breakfast or adding significant quantities of fruit to your oatmeal youll want to open a couple of packs each time you sit down  thats a bit annoying  you could solve this one problem by buying the larger cups  but theyre a much worse value caloriefordollar  and the second problem below still appliesbr br second there is so much packaging and unnecessary waste  its absurd that  ounces of oatmeal is spread out over six boxes each of which contains eight microscopic paper bags of oatmealbr br these problems could be solved by just selling singlecontainer bags of oatmeal  the result would be less waste and packaging and an easier time servingbr br still overall this is a good product,neutral,positive
"I bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper, and I made some as soon as I got them. It is the best popcorn I've had. I thought I would mind the smaller kernel size, but I didn't. There is substantially less hull than regular popcorn. The flavor is great. I suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn. It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals).

"I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company).

I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, ""normal"" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray.

"When I first tried this coffee it had a dark, rich, overly strong flavor and color. In fact it was a bit bitter and was definately not a blend I would recommend.

I like my coffee black but not bitter or unduly strong and usually use Starbuck's or Seattle's Best French Roast. I still prefer them over this brand but would definately buy a bag of this without hesitation. It had a very low acidity content and even after being in a thermos for a number of hours it retained it's flavor and aroma. If you like a strong, rich blend this is the coffee for you.

"I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say ""That's hot!"".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.

"These are great for making larger portions of baby food. I think I'll use them more as my baby gets older. For my 7-month-old, one cube makes about 2-3 servings of food for her.

The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.

"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.<br /><br />I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:<br /><br />#1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and<br />#2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.<br /><br />Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.<br /><br />Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker.",i am thorougly disgusted with betty crocker for this product glutenfree bisquick which is a shame because i do applaud them for their excellent cake cookie and brownie mixesbr br im not upset with them for for coming out with a glutenfree baking mix but forbr br  marketing it as though its an equivalent to bisquick andbr  for pricing it so ridiculously highbr br ingredients for regular bisquick enriched flour partiallly hydrogenated soybean andor cottonseed oil leavening dextrose saltbr br ingredients for glutenfree bisquick  rice flour sugar leavening baking soda sodium aluminum phosphate monocalcium phosphate modified potato starch salt xanthan gumbr br notice anything missing from the ingredients of glutenfree bisquick yup thats righttheres no shortening or oilbr br that was the whole point of the original bisquicka baking mix that already had the shortening mixed in  that avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  that is why people buy baking mixesfor that specific conveniencebr br betty crocker has decided to leave out the shortening or oil altogether even though shortening or oil is always naturally glutenfree so they cant pretend its a safetyforceliacs factor  its a costsavings to them pure and simplebr br heres the breakdown of what youre paying  a pound forbr rice flour  cents a pound at my local asian storebr sugar  for a  pound bag at walmart br potato starch also  cents a pound at the asian storebr baking powder  a pound at emergency essentialsbr salt  for  ounces of mortonsbr xanthan gum  for  ounce on amazonbr br yes xanthan gum is expensivebut very very little is needed a ounce box of glutenfree bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gummaybe  cents worth of xanthan gumbr br betty crocker is charging over  times what it would cost you to make their mix at home while eliminating the major convenience factor and cost to themselves but not to you of their regular baking mixbr br i dont mind their making a fair profit especially if the product really were the equivalent of regular bisquick  but theyre gouging us and being misleading about the productbr br make your own easily and for less than  of what they chargebr br since theres no oil in glutenfree bisquick you can easily stir up an equivalent make  pounds or more at a time with very little effort and it will keep for several monthsbr br or if you want a real bisquick substitutes betterbatterorg has a recipe on the site for a cupforcup substitute for bisquick that does use shortening and nonfat dry milk powder  or you can use buttermilk powder or even vances dairyfree powder  it makes  cups at a time stores well and you dont have to use their glutenfree flouryou can use any glutenfree flour replacement you want like rice flour and potato starch from your local asian store mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum about  teaspoon for every two cupsbr br to find the recipe do a google search of betterbatter bisquick substitute master mixbr br boo on betty crocker,negative,positive

"I've been a connoisseur of fine tea for many years.  Yet, I can no longer afford to frequent the fine tea rooms and tea stores that I used to, which offered my favorite varieties and international brands.  Subsequently, I've had to settle for lessor quality brands sold in most major supermarkets.<br /><br />Knowing how much I enjoy superior tea, my daughter-in-law chose Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a holiday gift.  I could not have been more pleased!  *I regret that I delayed writing this review. Yet, with Mother's Day approaching, I'm hoping for another gift set.<br /><br />Bentley's Royal Green Tea is a superb collection of fine tea which is equal in quality and taste to some of the world's best green tea I've enjoyed.  This elegantly wrapped gift-set offers 6 varieties of special blends of green tea and fruit blends, from exotic fruits to popular favorites, such as Mango or Raspberry.<br /><br />Each teabag is securely sealed in a beautifully designed packet, with an elegant artistic image representing the fruit which flavors that teabag.  Bentley's goes further by providing a sturdy wood-like case, designed with 6 separate sections, each section containing 6 teabags of one flavor.  This solid well-designed dark-green case holds a total of 36 individually wrapped tea bags in its six compartments; a case which aptly resembles a jewelry box for the true 'jewels' of exquisite fine teabags it holds.  Indeed, when you lift the firm lid on this elegant case of fine tea, you will know you have a treasure-chest of great varieties of fine green tea.<br /><br />I was especially impressed that each teabag was expertly measured and prepared to effect the perfect aroma and optimal taste for the average teacup.

"My canine companion is a 132 pound, five year old, Shiloh Shepherd.  The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.  That said, after an adequate therapeutic trial, I feel confident in recommending Pinnacle.",my canine companion is a  pound five year old shiloh shepherd  the shiloh shepherd is considered a giant breed  with his enormous size athleticism and the general nutrient demands we all must consider his diet has always been a primary consideration  not to mention he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the german shepherd breed  his breeder has always been partial to premium edge lamb  this is the formula he was weaned on  i had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimenbr br then to my dismay i learned premium edge was placed on a recent recall list  i knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend but i had to take immediate action  and at the time of recall i didnt have time to gradually transition to a new diet which is always the way to go to avoid negative symptomsbr br after carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble i opted to give pinnacle trout  sweet potato a try ordering a  pound starter bag from amazon  in addition i ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phasebr br the bag arrived  i opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be  the first whiff out of the bag was strong smelling of fish  i noted the kibble size itself was quite small for a large breed dog but felt this was only a minor reservation  the ultimate test was not what i thought about it but what my shiloh would  he immediately had a positive response  in fact  he loves it  he appears more enthusiastic about it than the premium edgebr br i had to start the pinnacle before the enzymes arrived so i was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea  well that was not the case  he has gone through the  pound bag and half of the next order  a  pound bag with no diarrhea or gas at all  in fact his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet  supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessarybr br im delighted with this new regimen  i also love that i can order a  pound bag through amazon and have it delivered to my front door  im now avoiding a considerable drive  and  the backbreakingdiscomfort of lugging around heavy bags of kibblebr br my dog is happy and im happy  that said after an adequate therapeutic trial i feel confident in recommending pinnacle,positive,positive

"The Switch in Kiwi Berry is a good tasting carbonated drink. It's fruity sweet with a bit of tang.<br /><br />We have made our own carbonated juice or punch drinks in the past using a home carbonating gadget. While it's not hard to do this, we can only make limited quantities and it's not very portable. But we love the results.<br /><br />The Switch took this same idea and packaged in their rather smallish cans. (Good size for kids, a bit too small for adults.) I'm still concerned with the sugar involved. At 35 grams a can, it still seems a bit much. But there is no caffeine, no added corn syrup, no added sugar, or other ingredients normally found in colas.<br /><br />But for what it is, The Switch soda is quite tasty.

"My wife and I decided that we wanted to begin having miso soup for dinner on a more regular basis, so purchased this tofu as an essential ingredient for my miso soup recipe. I was totally impressed with the individual packaging of the tofu (and the fact that it doesn't need to be refrigerated), the taste and texture, and the overall product quality. Needless to say, I am reordering and will continue to do so. I want to say that my picky kids also love this tofu as well -- for kids that seem to only want mac & cheese, they are gorging themselves on (much healthier) miso soup now. This makes me happy. By the way, I also highly recommend the Roland White Miso Paste (incredible flavor and great quality) and the Ajinomoto Hon Dashi Soup Stock which I both purchased from Amazon.  If interested, my Miso Soup recipe is as follows: 1 package of Morinu firm silken tofu (this stuff), 2 tsp Dashi soup stock, 3 TBS white miso paste, 4 cups of water and 2 chopped scallions -- we also reconstitute shitake mushrooms, add dried wakame seaweed (highly recommend either Eden or Emerald Cove from Amazon as well), add shaved daikon, etc. However, this recipe is awesome just as is...

"McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.

It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. I would have never bought it had I known.

"This hot sauce has an excellent taste, unlike most of Dave's Insanity sauces. I put 6-10 drops into a bowl of mild chili to make it hot. Like the other reviewer, I'd put it at about 1 million SHUs. Having eaten fresh bhut jolokia (ghost) peppers which are supposed to be 1 million SHUs, I'd compare it to those.<br /><br />4 million SHUs would mean that the sauce is 25% pure capsaicin. That would make it prohibitively expensive to manufacture or consume.",this hot sauce has an excellent taste unlike most of daves insanity sauces i put  drops into a bowl of mild chili to make it hot like the other reviewer id put it at about  million shus having eaten fresh bhut jolokia ghost peppers which are supposed to be  million shus id compare it to thosebr br  million shus would mean that the sauce is  pure capsaicin that would make it prohibitively expensive to manufacture or consume,positive,positive

"I absolutely love these crackers. The taste is just right. Just enough sea salt, just enough olive oil, just crisp enough, just the right texture. Easily my favorite flavored cracker at this point in time.<br /><br />So why not a 5?<br /><br />Well, writegirl is correct in her review below. I have yet to get a box that was not at least 50% broken. For my purposes, this is not a huge problem as I never use them to dip or for hors d'oeuvres. I tend to eat them plain as snacks. But if you intend to use them to entertain, or need them intact to hold a topping, then you may have a problem.",i absolutely love these crackers the taste is just right just enough sea salt just enough olive oil just crisp enough just the right texture easily my favorite flavored cracker at this point in timebr br so why not a br br well writegirl is correct in her review below i have yet to get a box that was not at least  broken for my purposes this is not a huge problem as i never use them to dip or for hors doeuvres i tend to eat them plain as snacks but if you intend to use them to entertain or need them intact to hold a topping then you may have a problem,positive,positive
"I also reviewed the Jones Soda Berry Pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over $1 per bottle.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor. It's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) which gives it a lot of tang/bite. For me it isn't unpleasant at all - I like it.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviews, I don't get the medicine aftertaste. It's just a good, refreshing, carbonated drink. I tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst. I tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great. I like it over ice better, though. Then, just for fun, I added some Malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and it's not bad. I won't be asking for it at a bar, but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and I think if someone was creative, this could be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />The down side (to me) is this is another fairly pricey drink. The cans aren't full-size cans either. So for almost $1 per can you get a smallish 8.3 ounces but with regular sodas you get 12 ounces - half again as much. Of course, sodas aren't 100% juice either.<br /><br />Upshot is if I'm on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty, I'd probably buy this. For stocking at home, I'll stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton. I would recommend trying it for yourself, though. This seems to be one of those drinks that could sway pretty hard depending on personal preferences.",i also reviewed the jones soda berry pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over  per bottlebr br the switch orange tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor its also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid vitamin c which gives it a lot of tangbite for me it isnt unpleasant at all  i like itbr br contrary to other reviews i dont get the medicine aftertaste its just a good refreshing carbonated drink i tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst i tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great i like it over ice better though then just for fun i added some malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and its not bad i wont be asking for it at a bar but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and i think if someone was creative this could be a match made in heavenbr br the down side to me is this is another fairly pricey drink the cans arent fullsize cans either so for almost  per can you get a smallish  ounces but with regular sodas you get  ounces  half again as much of course sodas arent  juice eitherbr br upshot is if im on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty id probably buy this for stocking at home ill stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton i would recommend trying it for yourself though this seems to be one of those drinks that could sway pretty hard depending on personal preferences,positive,neutral
"These pork rinds taste very good and it's a great value. I have found that the trick to cooking these is to not put too many on a plate at once. Literally 10 - 12 ""disks"" is the max I cook at once and they turn out great. I have found that if I try to cook too many at once they either take a very long time to puff up (5 minutes) or when they cook, they don't puff all the way, leaving the hardened bits that previous reviewers mentioned. Once you get the cooking down right, they're a great snack!",these pork rinds taste very good and its a great value i have found that the trick to cooking these is to not put too many on a plate at once literally    disks is the max i cook at once and they turn out great i have found that if i try to cook too many at once they either take a very long time to puff up  minutes or when they cook they dont puff all the way leaving the hardened bits that previous reviewers mentioned once you get the cooking down right theyre a great snack,positive,positive
"These are beautiful, smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads, ""New technology"", so, I'm figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably upped their quality control as well.

"Beautiful plants, great value, well cared for and packaged perfectly. The only thing I would include in the future is care instructions. I'd like to know how they are cared for by the seller so that I can continue the care at home. Some people mist these plants while others soak them in a bowl of water; which method do these prefer? I will be making this my exclusive go to guy/gal for ordering these plants and others in the future. Super impressed!
